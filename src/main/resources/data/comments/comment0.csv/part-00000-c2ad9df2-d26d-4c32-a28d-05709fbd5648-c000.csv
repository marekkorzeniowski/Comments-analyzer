0,1,NEGATIVE,"@Nick122 In a parliamentary system like the Norwegian one can essentially give a negative vote to a party by voting for a party that promises not to cooperate with the given party. I don't see that as a bad thing, though."
0,0,NEGATIVE,"Yes, but you will give a negative vote by voting for your candidate as well while even further advancing him."
0,1,NEGATIVE,"Not exactly an answer, but a few thoughts come to mind. One obvious disadvantage is about its non-democratic nature. In places with extraordinary corruption and criminality, mandatory vote could help in cases where people are prevented from voting by criminals with association with some party or candidate. I'm not sure of the chances of that happening, but it's the most common argument in favor of mandatory vote or at least mandatory justification, which is what we have in Brasil."
0,9,NEGATIVE,"Hello! I think this question is asking an important one, but it's currently phrased in a way that solicits opinions rather than concrete answers. I strongly suggest you edit your question into something stronger!"
0,17,NEUTRAL,"Therefore, the [Nolan Chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart) is popular among libertarians. The chart tries to characterize political positions on a two-axis model, one axis being &quot;social authoritarian vs libertarian&quot;, the other &quot;economically left vs right&quot;."

0,1,NEGATIVE,"I'm not sure if most democratic countries on a worldwide level has recall or not, but it's unusual in Europe, that's fore sure. I've never heard of it outside the USA. The countries that are listed on Wikipedia as having it USA, Canada, Venezuela and Switzerland.  No the Norwegian Wikipedia the Phillipines is also listed. So I'm fairly comfortable saying that most democratic countries do not have it, but I have no authoritative source.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election"
0,0,NEGATIVE,"The word &quot;natural&quot; means only &quot;something I like&quot;. There is no objective definition of the word that doesn't end up with either anything or nothing being &quot;natural&quot;. It is therefore a completely subjective question and needs rephrasing. I made an answer anyway, based on &quot;fair&quot; instead of &quot;natural&quot;. As for mathematical models, if you make a model of income distribution where everyone gets exactly the same thing, there will be no economic inequality. That is not &quot;unnatural&quot; it just won't work in practice. :-)"
0,2,NEGATIVE,"@cls: And two dimensions is twice as good as one, but since once dimension is near useless.... :-) The Nolan chart also is very bad because it's still based on the concepts of left and right, which mean nothing. So in fact it only really has one dimension as opposed to zero. Which of course can be claimed to be infinitely better. ;-)"
0,0,NEUTRAL,"@cls: No sorry, I was thinking of the political compass, not the Nolan Chart. The Nolan Chart is OK. It actually has two dimensions."
0,0,NEGATIVE,"Yeah, you should rephrase that (I made an attempt). Inequality in &quot;such a model&quot; would be a stable equilibrium complete dependent on what &quot;such a model&quot; is. It seems now that you are talking specifically about the Persson/Tabellini and Alesina/Rodrik models. That should be made clearer."
0,0,NEUTRAL,Can you please elaborate or reference what language specifically in the 16th ammendment allows for this?
0,1,POSITIVE,I've added the entire text of the amendment to my answer.
0,1,NEGATIVE,"Just for a cultural comparison, again from the *Oxford Handbook*: “The available evidence suggests that the American poor work harder than their European equivalents and have a lower probability of exiting from poverty. Yet 60 percent of Americans believe that their poor are lazy and have tremendous opportunities, while 60 percent of Europeans believe that the poor are trapped.”"
0,2,NEGATIVE,@Merbs Funny you mention that because this still can be explained by the model above.  Income inequality numbers are lower in western Europe than in the US.  If the numbers were in fact higher than it can be anticipated that European attitude towards the non-working poor would sour.  One should also consider the higher rates of unemployment in western Europe than in the US as well.
0,0,NEUTRAL,"Yes, but the title is still very bad. &quot;Models&quot; is unspecified and you still use the word &quot;natural&quot;."
0,1,NEUTRAL,Thank you.  This seems to destroy the credibility of any claims made by people who believe this seems to be fundamentally and totally irrelevant.
0,0,NEGATIVE,"I think it is a good definition, but must also at least have the very basic characteristics of a Democracy, direct or representative rule with citizens voting on representatives.  A democracy in the very least must have elections and be possible to change without violent revolution."
0,4,NEGATIVE,"@SvenClement The first part was background for &quot;states are free to choose electors however they want, so they don't even need to have a ballot in the traditional sense&quot;, which is the actual answer. There aren't federal rules for who can be on the ballot because there isn't even a federal rule that there has to be a ballot. The only federal rule is the states choose electors somehow; currently they all use ballots, but that's because each state chooses to"
0,2,NEGATIVE,"Nice update! The problem with point 4 is that debt as a percentage of the GDP is no more accurate.  Lets say you make 100,000 a year, and owe 50,000.  You get a raise to 110,000, but you still owe 50,000.  Yes the percent of debt is lower, but you still owe 50,000 in debt.  Simply because revenues have increased does not mean that progress was made towards paying off the debt.  The &quot;Great Recession&quot; is a great example of this.  The revenues decreased, and the debt increased, so the percentage is now higher.  Can you explain how debt as a percentage of GDP is more accurate?"
0,8,NEUTRAL,Possibly because each side knows they'll be in the minority often enough.
0,1,NEGATIVE,"@maple_shaft: There are arguments about whether the amendment was properly ratified and whether its language was effective, but they're flimsier than a moth-eaten straw hat."
0,0,NEGATIVE,By &quot;natural&quot; I&quot;m asking whether inequality in such a model would be a stable equilibrium and if the dynamics of the system (best-response / gradient descent) inevitably lead the system there. My intuition is that such a model contains a threshold before which there is negative feedback (redistribution towards equality) and after which there is positive feedback (political influence towards inequality).
0,0,NEUTRAL,"Think about it.  The word 'No' is far more powerful than 'Yes'.  Blocking anything you want simply by saying No makes you more powerful than the guy supporting a bill.  Think of it in terms of a married couple making an important decision.  It takes two to make the decision, but it only takes one to say nothing and ensure that nothing is done.  Would any one person think it is a good idea to forgo their ability to say No to anything ever again just to win a single argument?  It would be foolish in the long term"
0,2,NEGATIVE,Lets not lump *all* the founding fathers with being worried about the tyranny of the majority.  It was typically Hamilton and the Federalists that were worried about the poor being the majority and voting their wealthy status away. The French Revolution cemented these fears. In fact the Federalists were the ones who were being accused of being aristocrats and monarchists.  Jefferson and the Anti-Federalist party were ardent supporters of the French Revolution and favored more of a parliamentary democracy over the Republic institutions established by what came to be the Federalists.
0,0,NEGATIVE,"Tim, correct. For the US is is just a legal requirement for those who meet the above conditions."
0,1,NEGATIVE,"@maple_shaft - oups, I had the Q open for editing to add in James Madison and got distracted. Fixed."
0,0,NEUTRAL,+1 for the last bit. I never could figure out what the difference is between any of the &quot;Independents&quot; in the Senate vs &quot;D&quot;s
0,0,NEUTRAL,"This is a great answer history-wise, but it doesn't seem to address the last part of the question: &quot;How is that different from them joining the party in question?&quot;. I will ask that separately I guess"
0,0,NEGATIVE,"@DVK I added an edit that expanded upon why they are inherently different.  Also it is not true that all Independents caucus with Democrats, Joe Lieberman is a notable example of an independent that had caucused with Republicans at one point."
0,1,NEGATIVE,did he officially caucus with Republicans? I was under (random) impression he voted Dem on ~90% of votes?
0,0,NEGATIVE,@TimPost - it's vice versa. Registered lobbyists face limitations that ordinary citizens do not.
0,1,NEUTRAL,"You are absolutely correct about only congress having the authority.  However, the president takes blame (or praise) for what happens during his administration.  Whether or not he should is another topic. The question could be rephrased to &quot;Who is the last president to oversee a reduction in debt?&quot;."
0,0,NEGATIVE,"@DVK His voting record aside, since his Independent tenure he has stated multiple times his dissatisfaction with Democratic politics and has talked with McConnell on a number of occasions of potentially caucusing with Republicans on an ongoing basis."
0,6,NEUTRAL,"@Pharmakon - that's precisely why I answered. This site is for professional political discussions, so dispelling such a major misconception seems important."
0,2,NEUTRAL,you said &quot;had caucused&quot;. That is different from &quot;had discussions about&quot; :)
0,0,NEUTRAL,This is wrong. There are implcations.
0,0,NEUTRAL,This is the most correct answer. Nice one.
0,0,NEUTRAL,Care to find another source?
0,0,NEGATIVE,@KevinPeno - How is Wikipedia insufficient?
0,0,NEGATIVE,Let me go find a reference to a yahoo answer as to why its not the best source ;) (http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090511152328AA4BsVG)
0,0,NEGATIVE,"Well, according to the Department of the Treasury at http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm, the exact debt was $907B"
0,1,NEGATIVE,"The OP edited the question so this answer doesn't really fit anymore, and then accepted it. I'm confused"
0,1,NEGATIVE,This too far-reached as an answer. The access to the other institutions was alreafy given to Palestinians as part of Israel. While politically not liked this was the case before the admission. Even if it is a de facto recognition that is still short of being more than a symbolic act. Only full membership equals to formal recognition.
0,2,NEGATIVE,This may be hard to answer objectively since different political persuasions would disagree one what &quot;success&quot; is (Ex: Romneycare and Obamacare)
0,0,NEUTRAL,@SvenClement - cite?
0,0,POSITIVE,"@DVK, very true, although I'd even be interested in examples where &quot;success&quot; is debated as long as there is a long enough track record to where at least the record can at least be looked at objectively."
0,0,NEGATIVE,"A lot of disagreement and subjectivity is in defining the metrics/goals, not the facts. For example, is welfare system a success or not? We don't even agree on some of the statuses (&quot;keeps generations of people on government dole trapping them in a cycle of cultural dependency on daddy government&quot; vs &quot;provides a safety net to vulnerable members of society&quot;)."
0,3,NEGATIVE,"The list including &quot;extreme right&quot; was meant to be just examples, as the &quot;extreme left&quot; certainly does exist - Communism is considered far- or extreme- left"
0,0,NEGATIVE,"Google has  4,550,000 results for &quot;Extreme right politics&quot; and  1,360,000 for &quot;extreme left politics&quot;"
0,0,NEUTRAL,"&quot;The international community regards the West Bank and East Jerusalem as territories occupied by Israel, and, although it has withdrawn its military forces, Israel continues to be designated the occupying power in the Gaza Strip by the United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom and various human rights organizations.&quot; (Wikipedia but can cite other sources) This implies that inhabitants of the region can be internationally represented under the Israeli denomination. Also having access to the Criminal Court."
0,0,NEGATIVE,@SvenClement - I am not sure how your second sentence is implied by the first one.
0,0,NEGATIVE,Didn't this get covered in Skeptics.SE already? I have vague recollection of a similar Q there
0,1,NEGATIVE,"@maple_shaft: Well, Poppers definition says that you don't have to have elections, you only have to be possible to change without violence. So a system with direct democracy, that only have votes but no elections would still be considered democratic with this definition."
0,0,NEGATIVE,If a country is occupied its citizens are subject to the law of the occupier which implies that they also get the international recognition as a part of the occupiers territory. This implies that they already had the possibility to go to the ICC which could of course decline to hear any case. But being an observing non-member is not precondition for that.
0,4,NEGATIVE,"@Pharmakon: &quot;Accurate&quot;? I didn't say accurate, I said it's more *relevant*. If you increase your income you also increase the amount of debts you can take on without crashing your economy. A country with 1 billion dollars in debt and 1 billion dollars in GDP is heavily in debt. A country with 1 billion dollars in debt and a GDP of 1 trillion dollars is practically debt free."
0,4,NEGATIVE,@GDP: Your point being? This answer is inconsistent in it's reasoning and the claim that Carter was the last president to reduce debt is factually incorrect.
0,0,NEGATIVE,"While this is overall a great answer, I'm deeply curious to know of even a single example of Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer &quot;moving across party lines&quot; (especially on a substantial issue)."
0,0,NEUTRAL,I was too.  I considered it over lunch with my coworkers.  This answer does not reflect the intent of the question.  I am restoring the original answer.
0,8,NEGATIVE,"@PearsonArtPhoto Just to clarify, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were in no way arch rivals nor were they enemies. They were in fact close friends their entire lives, they simply disagreed with each other often. Jefferson was an Anti-Federalist and Adams retained Washington's old cabinet that were all Federalists. Politically Adams was Neutral sometimes siding with Federalists and other times with Anti-Federalists. People often mistake the fierce rivalry that Jefferson had with Adams' cabinet secretaries as a rivalry."
0,0,NEGATIVE,Are these numbers adjusted for inflation?
0,0,NEGATIVE,"@Raymond: That's covered in the previous citation, the [12th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)."
0,0,NEUTRAL,Good point. I've changed it to say politically speaking.
0,1,NEGATIVE,"There might be a difference between the system in theory and the system in practice. Does the Communist Party of China really allow for independent people to run for election, or for party members to be delegated to the Party Congress if their views diverge? It might still be easier for an outsider to get in in say, Italy (Beppo Grillo) than it is in China. I don't know, just thinking."
0,1,NEGATIVE,"To improve your question, can you summarise briefly what range voting is? Links can die and even if that's unlikely on Wikipedia, it's good if questions are as much as possible self-contained."
0,0,NEGATIVE,"Well, the outsider in Italy will not land in prison (at least not in most cases), but he will have practically no influence too."
0,0,NEGATIVE,"Lords cannot block bills, only amend or delay them. If one house makes revisions it must be sent to the other to approve it or make further revisions until both houses agree on the final document. Bi (not Bye) elections are only held when an MP becomes unable to perform his/her duties. Otherwise it is a a general election when the entire country elects their MPs. The house of lords rarely (I don't think it can) introduces bills, that is done solely by the house of commons."
0,0,NEGATIVE,Royal assent is simply ceremonial. The queen theoretically has the power to block it but she would be deposed and as such she does not truly have this power. Principal figures of political parties - not nessisarily. They can sit in lords too. It is generally the leader of the party and the cabinet (or shadow cabinet for the opposition) chosen by the leader of the party that sit in commons. Other senior people in the party such as the chairman may sit in either house and they have whips etc. for the house of lords too.
0,0,NEUTRAL,@Aarthi: No they are not adjusted for inflation.
0,0,NEGATIVE,"Irrelevant? The correct answer should be &quot;None&quot;, from this point of view. ;-)"
0,0,NEUTRAL,I would add that they were together because an economical interest before a political interest.
0,1,NEGATIVE,@whoever downvoted - it's not really very sportsmanlike to downvote an answer that was completely correct **at the time the question was being answered**.
0,1,NEGATIVE,"Well, `help people in their countries and find ways the countries can help each other out` is very broad and covers that it was for all national/international interests. As I said, I was aiming for simplicity as that was how I interpreted the question."
0,1,NEGATIVE,"As Lennart said, there is zero &quot;Demorcatic&quot; about the system. The definition of &quot;Democracy&quot; is every citizen having equal input into the decisions. In China, citizens (including a vast majority of Party members) have zero input."
0,1,NEGATIVE,The same thing could apply to parties such as UKIP. Their main policy and even the name of their party is all about gaining independence from the EU. What happens if this fails or what happens if they gain independence? Do they just disband the party as their main aim has been accomplished.
0,1,NEGATIVE,So there is nothing preventing the state to secede but there is nothing allowing it either?
0,0,NEUTRAL,"Basically, the constitution is silent on the issue."
0,4,NEUTRAL,The supreme court may resolve this issue.
