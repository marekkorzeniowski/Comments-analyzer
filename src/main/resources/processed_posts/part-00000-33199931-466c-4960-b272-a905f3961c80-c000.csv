1,What are the disadvantages of first-past-the-post electoral systems?,NEGATIVE,"We all know the situation could arise in the U.S. where one candidate wins the popular vote but another one the electoral college. Given that the same could arise in the United Kingdom and other countries with a first-past-the-post or \"winner takes it all\" electoral system, what are the genuine disadvantages of first-past-the-post electoral systems? Besides the given examples?"
2,Why can't voting be fair if there are more than two alternatives?,NEGATIVE,"I've heard that mathematically it can be shown that given any voting system with more than two choices, voters can cheat the system by not voting their true opinions in order to game the system and help their first choice. Why is this the case and what would be an example of its application. How can democracies take this into account? Is it a real threat to fair elections or just a theoretical one?"
4,"",NEGATIVE,"First-past-the-post voting tends to result in a smaller number of viable candidates. In the traditional two-party system of Anglosphere politics, every candidate except those from the top two parties is effectively a spoiler; they weaken the position of whichever major party candidate is more ideologically similar to them, giving the other major party candidate an advantage. As a result, it is in people's interest to vote for a major party candidate even if they are more aligned with another candidate. This lessens voters' ability to support their preferred policies through voting. A great explanation of this is here."
5,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"Simple plurality voting has very little in its favor in any election with more than two candidates, but the top disadvantage is vote splitting. FPTP only allows voters to vote for a single person, and since the vote can't be transferred, if that person doesn't win that means the voter might as well have not voted at all. Imagine a situation like the following: Person A is liked by 60% of the electorate Person B is liked by the same 60% of the electorate Person C is liked by the remaining 40% of the electorate Assume that the 60% don't like C, and the 40% don't like A and B (it doesn't really matter either way, since FPTP doesn't care who you like after #1). It's unclear if A or B should win, but clearly C shouldn't -- a majority of people don't like him. However, if half the 60% vote for person A and the other half vote for person B, the results are: Person A gets 30% of the vote Person B gets 30% of the vote Person C gets 40% of the vote and wins Because person A and person B were so similar, they split the vote and neither got enough to win; they would've been better served if one of them had dropped out. Very similar to (but probably more ridiculous than) vote splitting is the spoiler effect. This happens when a similar minor candidate gets very little of the vote, but it's enough to tip the election the other way. For example: Person A gets 47% of the vote Person B gets 4% of the vote entirely from voters who would've voted for person A Person C gets 49% of the vote Person C wins by 2 points, but it's person B's fault -- if he hadn't run, person A would've won. Worst of all, everyone who voted for person B is kicking themselves because the person they liked least is now the winner. One of the desirable qualities of a voting system (according to Kenneth Arrow) is independence of irrelevant alternatives -- the introduction of a new candidate shouldn't change the winner unless it's to that candidate. Plurality voting is particularly bad at this. The result of all this is that FPTP bodies tend towards dual party systems after a while; the similar candidates fight it out in primaries so that in the real election, there's only two major choices and the effect of vote splitting is minimized. Nonetheless, spoilers can still cause problems. FPTP doesn't gather sufficient information to be certain when spoilers have changed a result, but in Gaming the Vote Poundstone estimates that at least five U.S. presidential elections have been decided by spoilers"
6,What are the advantages/disadvantages of a mandatory voting system?,NEGATIVE,"Living in a country where mandatory voting exists and experiencing the results in another without mandatory, I'm wondering: What are the advantages and disadvantages of mandatory voting?"
7,"What is meant by the \"left\" and the \"right\"?",NEUTRAL,"When discussing political issues and parties, I often hear mention of a party being \"left\", \"centre-left\", \"right\" or \"extreme right\". In broad terms, what do these designations mean?"
9,How do instant runoffs work?,NEUTRAL,I've read that some elections have instant runoffs. What are they and how do they work? How do they differ from a standard majority vote election?
12,How does direct democracy compare to representative democracy?,NEGATIVE,"Back in the olden days of Greece, direct democracy was practiced. All citizens could vote directly on every issue decided by the state. This is significantly different to the representative democracy practiced in almost all democratic countries today, whereby the people elect a much smaller group of representatives to vote on issues that the state will decide. How does direct democracy compare to representative democracy?"
13,"",NEGATIVE,"The standard terms of left and right politics originate from the seating arrangement of the French National Assembly of 1789. They are often considered overly simplistic for today's complex political landscape. In the 1789 at the French National Assembly the First Estate (noblemen) sat on the right side and the Third Estate (revolutionaries) sat on the left side. Thus, the left wing of the room was more liberal, and the right wing was more conservative. Today you often use the terms left or extreme-left to describe social and progressive measures and right or even extreme-right the more conservative and nationalistic approaches. Those terms as I stated in the first paragraph however are too simplistic for a modern world where libertarians are often very progressive (left) on social issues such as gay marriage but are fiscally very conservative (right)."
15,Why is the French democracy not using proportional representation for election of the assembly?,NEGATIVE,"Proportional representation was used during the French Fourth Republic, while other kinds of voting systems were preferred during the French Third Republic and the French Fifth Republic (with an exception between 1986 and 1987). Some political parties argue proportional representation is the only truly democratic voting system. Why is the French democracy not using proportional representation for election of the assembly?"
16,What are the consequences of recalling ambassadors?,NEGATIVE,Two days ago there were rumors Britain and France may recall their ambassadors from Israel. Why is that a political action? Wouldn’t that rather harm the citizens of these countries in Israel?
17,What challenges remain for online voting?,NEGATIVE,"In 2011, nearly a quarter (24.3%) of participating voters in Estonia cast their ballot by remote electronic voting (that is, on their computer/phone/tablet via the Internet). Several larger countries, including the United Kingdom (63M), France (65M), and the United States (312M) have experimented with the idea of Internet voting, but most applications are experimental or limited in scope. According to the Caltech/MIT voting technology project, Estonia’s success is in part due to: Widespread Internet penetration A legal structure that addresses Internet voting issues An identification system that allows for digital authentication of the voter A political culture supportive of Internet voting Detractors of Internet voting often highlight security flaws, though integrity of the secret ballot aside, it seems that we have (banking and medicine) systems that can handle information with sufficient security. Beyond this, what other categories of challenges prevent the widespread adoption of electronic voting? What challenges remain for online voting? Are they primarily technological or cultural?"
18,"",NEGATIVE,"In an IRV (instant-runoff voting) system you do not simply vote for one option, but you can rank options according to your preferences. Imagine that three candidates stand for election as mayor in your town. Candidate A (25%) Candidate B (30%) Candidate C (45%) In order for any candidate to win he would need at least 50% of the votes. Given that no candidate got the necessary votes, a runoff election will be held between the two strongest contenders. Normally this happens a while after the first election round. By using IRV you can conduct the runoff election directly after having counted the first round. As voters indicated their preferential ranking, you can eliminate the weakest candidate and redistribute the votes on his ballots according to the indicated second preference. This will be continued until at least one candidate gets 50% of the votes attributed to him. Everything happens in one election but is counted as often as there are rounds needed for one candidate to get at least 50% of the votes. Only in rare occasions can it happen that you need to conduct a second round of actual voting. In conclusion do they differ from standard majority elections that you always get a candidate that has at least 50% of the electorate backing her and you can do it in one single round of voting."
19,"",NEGATIVE,"The mathematical phenomenon you're talking about is Arrow's impossibility theorem. The wiki article has an informal proof. Specifically, the theorem states that there's no way to design a voting system such that all three of these criteria hold: If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y. If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change). There is no \"dictator\": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference. (The theorem is stated in terms of a rank-order voting system. The winner-take-all and first-past-the-post systems are degenerate cases of this; each voter is asked only for their first preference, and the candidate who is the first preference of a majority or plurality of voters wins.) Every democratic voting system fulfills the first and third criteria; therefore, they have to dispense with the second. This means that (for example) even if 60% of voters favor Candidate Alice over Candidate Bob, it's still possible for Bob to beat Alice. In a winner-take-all or first-past-the-post system, the way this would happen is through the introduction of a third candidate. If 30% of the voters now prefer Carl as their top choice, and all of those voters previously favored Alice over Bob, then Bob now has 40% of the vote while Alice and Carl each have 30%; Bob has beaten Alice. Voting systems such as instant-runoff voting can ameliorate this, but according to Arrow's impossibility theorem, they cannot entirely eliminate the possibility of a situation where Bob beats Alice even though a majority of the voters prefer Alice over Bob. The most important practical implication of this is that a democratic voting system can't entirely eliminate the spoiler effect. More broadly, it means the possibility always exists that it's in a voter's interest to vote in a way that doesn't reflect their true preferences; in other words, tactical voting is always a factor in elections. Most people in democratic countries accept this as an unfortunate reality of the system. Even so, some systems (such as winner-take-all) are more heavily impacted by tactical voting than others (such as instant-runoff)."
20,How does Single Transferable Vote work?,NEUTRAL,I've heard that some elections use single transferable vote. What is this and how does it work? How does it differ from a standard majority vote election?
21,"",NEGATIVE,"You're referring (I think) to Arrow's impossibility theorem, and \"voting can't be fair\" is an extremely common misinterpretation. What it actually says is that no rank-order voting system can simultaneously satisfy all of Arrow's criteria for the ideal voting system. First of all, the theorem only applies to rank-order voting, which is what most people are used to but not the only option out there. Rank-order voting is when you sort people in comparison to one another. FPTP is an example of rank-order voting, although the only ranks are \"#1\" and \"everyone else\". Another well-known system is the Borda count, where you rank everyone on the ballot, 1 through N. However, there's a totally separate class of voting called rated voting, where you judge each person individually. For example, on this site you don't sort the posts from best to worst; you take each one and either upvote it, downvote it, or abstain. This is essentially range voting (with the range set between -1 and 1), which is a type of rated voting. Arrow's impossibility theorem says nothing about rated voting, so it's possible for a voting system in this category to be fair, and indeed range voting has many advocates (I won't go so far as to say it's \"best\" because I'm not sure the experts will ever agree on that). Besides all that, Arrow's original criteria are quite strict. In particular, independence of irrelevant alternatives (adding a new candidate to an election shouldn't change the result unless they win -- it shouldn't result in another candidate that was in the election suddenly stealing the win from the original winner) is difficult to fully satisfy. Unfortunately, without it the system tends to suffer from the problem you mentioned upfront, strategic voting. For example, the Borda count is a rank-order voting system that satisfies all of Arrow's conditions except IIA, but is almost hilariously vulnerable to strategic voting -- you always want to rank your candidate's strongest opponent last, even if you actually like them second best. As to the last part of your question, using a weak voting system is definitely a real threat to fair voting, but Arrow's theorem doesn't just boil down to \"democracy is impossible\". There are many voting systems that are quite resistant to strategic voting, vote splitting, etc. The real problem is that we tend to not use them because they require more work. Plurality voting is attractive in that it requires checking one box, so it ends up in common use despite its problems. In short, we shouldn't worry too much about whether or not a voting system is perfect; picking one that's pretty good would be a vast improvement over the current situation in most elections"
22,"",NEGATIVE,"There are two challenges to online voting which can be seen as well technological as cultural. Challenge 1: You cannot at the same time have verifiability of an election and anonymous voting. This implies that you have to make a tradeoff between an anonymous election (as it is the case with paper ballots) and verifiability. If you want to be sure that each and every vote is counted, you have to identify every voter and provide him with a method to verify that his vote has been counted correctly. In order to do that you need to link voter to vote which would make an anonymous vote impossible. There are cultures (in working democracies) where public voting is common, so this is mostly a cultural question on how you see voting in those cultures. Nonetheless is there a risk, if a non-functioning democracy would implement a identity-linked voting system, that the regime could after the election prosecute the defectors. Challenge 2 Accessibility has to be always guaranteed While the penetration of modern technology has advanced, the knowledge on how to use it has not advanced at the same pace. In order for e-Voting to work (given Challenge 1 resolved) you would need to have people IT-literate enough to use a government-issued certificate to authenticate themselves and be able in general to use computers. This challenge will automatically be resolved over time, but at the moment, especially in ageing societies of the western hemisphere this is not a given fact."
24,Is it possible to implement an electronic voting system which is as secure as pen-and-paper voting?,NEGATIVE,"There is ongoing criticism of voting machines, due to the ease of manipulating the outcome of a vote that is counted digitally. I have heard the opinion that every computer-implemented voting procedure, including electronic voting via the internet, is in principle more susceptible to manipulation than traditional pen-and-paper voting. Is this true, or are there electronic voting concepts that have the desired properties of paper voting?"
25,"",NEGATIVE,"During the French revolution the most radical politics were sitting on left site, the most conservative on the right. So traditionally the conservatists (the ones who want to preserve existing order) are considered rightists, while the people who want to change it are considered leftists. This divide functions quite well in USA, where rightists (conservatists) are fighting for traditional American values such as right to possess arms and corporation-friendly law. In Europe the situation is much more complicated. Where the Nazi rightists or leftists? They wanted to overthrow the existing order. But they are considered rightists, because they glorified the right of the strong over the weak. In Europe someone who cares for weak and want to protect them from stronger is considered leftist. There comes also the attitude towards religion. The politics who consider religion as basis of social relations are considered rightists and those who oppose - leftist. However, there are christian-socialist parties which are both religious-driven and concentrated on the poorest and the weakest. On the other side we have radical liberal parties, which are both against religion and for the lower taxes and low social expenses, which are hard to classify as leftists or rightists."
26,"What are some examples of \"checks and balances\" outside of the United States?",NEGATIVE,"The three branches of the United States government (legislative, executive, and judicial) all participate in the governing process and in many cases can check the actions of another branch. Are there other systems of checks and balances that prevent a part of a government from overstepping its bounds different from the kind that the US uses?"
27,"",NEGATIVE,"\"Single transferable vote\" is a fairly apt name -- you still get one vote, but the system attempts to maximize its efficiency by transferring the vote between candidates, instead of just sticking you with whomever your top choice was. To do this, STV requires that you fill out a ranked ballot, sorting the candidates from most- to least-liked. To start with, everyone's #1 choice gets 1 vote, and the scores are summed. It's possible depending on the votes and the threshold for winning (which varies depending on the type of STV in use) that one person has enough votes to win. If they do and this is a single-seat election, that's it. If not: If there is a winner but the election is for multiple seats, the person who is over the threshold wins one of the seats. However, they might have more votes than they needed, and STV doesn't like wasting votes. It takes as many votes as it can from the winner (without dropping them under the threshold) and redistributes them to the remaining candidates (how this redistribution is decided also varies depending on the type of STV). This is why the voters need to select multiple options. Then we go back to the top and see if another person has crossed the threshold If there are still empty seats but nobody has enough votes to win one, we eliminate the person in last place and redistribute 100% of their votes to the remaining candidates, just like we do with the excess votes for the winner. Then we see if anybody has won You can see many examples of STV on Stack Exchange itself -- Meek STV is used to decide moderator elections. STV avoids many of the problems with plurality voting (see What are the disadvantages of first-past-the-post electoral systems?), while still remaining relatively simple. It's not even necessary to fill out the entire ballot (Stack Exchange only requires you select your top three choices), although with a large enough election or poor enough choices you run the risk of your vote not counting because none of your candidates made it to the end"
28,"",NEGATIVE,"There a few things that come to mind. Advantages: The votes are a representative sample of the whole population, not just the people who are active enough to want to vote. Because everyone has to vote, the whole country may become more politically literate and they might actually learn what their positions on different issues are, allowing them to make very informed decisions about their choice. Disadvantages: If Advantage 2 does not happen, the (majority/ large minority?) of people who vote might not actually know what the people running stand for, and because they have to vote, they must choose a candidate. This could have the effect of swaying the vote to the candidate that is worse in the long run. Although, that is all hypothetical, it might not happen. A possible result of Advantage 2 is that the country may become more politically divided much quicker. I know that the United States has started to become very politically divided, and I feel that it is very possible that it may have happened faster if everyone was very strong in knowing how they stand on every issue."
29,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"The single transferable vote (STV) is a system where you can vote for more than one option at the same time, but in a ranked fashion. Your vote is first allocated to your first preference but if that doesn't meet the threshold for the next round is then allocated to your next-highest preference that is still in the run. Given the following situation: We have 5 candidates (A through E) and 20 voters that need to pick 3 winners. The following votes have been casted: Votes 4 2 8 4 1 1 Pref 1 A B C C D E Pref 2 / A D E / / The first step is to calculate the threshold needed for a choice to be win. In this case this is ((20 votes cast/(3 winners + 1)) + 1) = 6. We then get the following counting of the votes: Candidate A B C D E Rnd 1 4 2 8 + 4 1 1 Candidate C is the first winner as 12 > 6 Rnd 2 4 2 6 5 3 The surplus votes from C to the second choices. As no candidate reaches 6, B with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rnd 3 6 / 6 5 3 B's votes are distributed to the second preference. A reaches the threshold exactly, thus leaving no surplus to distribute. Rnd 4 6 / 6 5 3 None of the remaining candidates D or E reach the threshold, so the 3rd winner is D with the most votes over E. The result yields as winners: A, C and D In a traditional standard majority system, you would have had to organize three distinctive election rounds while with STV you could do it all with one ballot and one voting round."

The last five presidents have all added to the overall debt*. Who is the last US president to decrease the total amount of debt owed by the Federal government? *(Including Bill Clinton; it is a common misconception that he paid down debt. He paid down some of the public debt, but the amount of intra-governmental debt increased offsetting the gains he made in paying off the public debt)"
35,Why is the UK Administration not separate from the house?,NEGATIVE,"In the UK, the lower house of parliament is also in charge of governmental bodies, as this web page shows. Why is the UK Government/Administration and House all rolled into one entity? The head of the majority party in the house is the prime minister making him the head of government/administration. Why not have a separate administration/government and house such as happens in america?"
36,Why does the US Congress have two chambers?,NEGATIVE,"Why does the US have separate houses (House of Representatives and Senate) to form Congress? Put another way, what is the reasoning behind a bicameral legislature in the USA?"
37,"",NEGATIVE,"This would depend on what you consider \"the desired properties of paper voting\". Applied Cryptography lists these requirements for secure online elections: Only registered voters can vote Voters can only vote once Nobody can determine a particular's voter's vote Nobody can change a voter's vote after it's been submitted Nobody can duplicate another voter's choice (voting for the same person, even without knowing who it is) Voters can verify that their vote was counted correctly Voting electronically in person is essentially the same as voting by physical ballot, so most of the conditions are satisfied. The problem is the lack of a paper trail: there's no guarantee that the machine has actually recorded the vote you told it, regardless of what it says on the screen (on the other hand, there's no guarantee that the poll worker didn't light your ballot on fire as soon as you turned around). Nonetheless, this could be solved by issuing each voter a unique ID and giving them a web interface that maps the ID to the vote, so they can check from home. Voting online is much more complicated and throws all the requirements into question. Presumably you have some way to issue each registered voter a unique nonce, even if it involves mailing it to them. Given this, there are cryptographic schemes that provide a way to let everyone submit their votes to a centralized tabulator (or even a decentralized system, although these tend to be infeasible and aren't necessary here anyway) that satisfies all these requirements. The easiest way to ensure a secret ballot is to anonymize the initial nonce distribution, although it's difficult for the voters to know for sure that this has been done (i.e. it requires a degree of trust in the central authority)"

And with whom do they register? Are registered lobbyists given special consideration that unregistered lobbyists (or average citizens) are not?"
40,"",NEGATIVE,"The House of Representatives The purpose of the House of Representatives was to ensure adequate representation of the people to the Federal Government. This was expected to resolve the issue the rebels had with Britain not allocating representatives to the colonies, yet taxing them directly. Without a voice, the colonies had no recourse to new taxes directed to them. The Senate The purpose of the Senate was to ensure limited government and local state power. By giving each state two representatives, no one state had any greater power over another, like was possible in the house. Additionally, by having the Senate elected by the state house rather than majority, it further secured local state power at the federal level. This of course changed with the 17th Amendment, which required Senators be elected by the populous at large. Summary With both houses having their various power centers, federal level representatives could not do anything without the states agreeing, and vice verse. The combination of both was supposed to limit federal power overall."
41,"",NEGATIVE,"The U.S. Congress didn't actually start out bicameral; the original Articles of Confederation (the pre-Constitution) had a single house. The final Constitution split Congress into the House and Senate as a compromise between the large states (who naturally wanted representation to be tied to population) and the small states (who didn't want to get outvoted all day long by the larger states). Rather than pick one, they made two houses, one with representation by population and one with equal representation for each state. The side-benefit of this split is the two houses can have completely different rules, powers, etc., and can contribute to checks and balances by watching each other. For example, only the House is allowed to pass an article of impeachment, but it's the Senate's job to actually try the impeached official. The House focuses on internal matters, particularly money, while the Senate deals with foreign policy. More broadly, the Senate is thought to be the more mature of the houses. The minimum age is higher, and the senators serve longer terms. The House exists to serve the people as closely as possible (which is why they come from individual, relatively small districts) while the Senate exists to handle the harder, long-term issues"

An exception is that lobbyists who earn less than $3,000 per client for each quarter, or whose total lobbying expenses are less than $11,500 each quarter, do not need to register. Part-time lobbyists are exempt from registering unless they spend more than 20% of their working hours doing lobbying activities in any quarter. If lobbyists have two or more contacts with a legislator as a lobbyist, then they must register. Requirements for registering also apply to companies that specialize in lobbying, or ones that have an in-house lobbyist, particularly if they spend more than $11,500 on lobbying."

Using cryptography, it is possible to give voters a code so that they can verify if their vote was counted correctly, but without the government knowing what you voted. Most people assume that in order to verify your vote, the government would have to have a database listing what everyone voted, instead of just keeping a tally. However, what you can do instead is store a encrypted version of your vote (E). After voting, the voter receives a code that is necessary to decrypt E. It is also possible to design the system so that the voter can not only see what they voted, but actually prove it. ie. the system makes in impossible to create a fake code showing the voted for someone else to frame the government for voter fraud"
47,What are the advantages/disadvantages of fixed-term elections?,NEGATIVE,"Fixed-term elections are those whose date can not be set by politicians. The US presidential election is perhaps the most prominent example of this. There are also elections, such as that for the Australian House of Representatives, which have a date effectively set by the head of government (so long as it falls within a certain number of years since the previous election). What are the advantages and disadvantages of these two systems?"
48,"",NEGATIVE,"Essentially, the key is to select a good random sample. In general, the sample is accurate to half of the square root of the number of people who are asked. Given the standard number of 1000 people, that means that the number should be accurate to within 17 people or so. Divide by the original 1000 people in half, and taking 17/500, and you have the traditional 3.4% error boundaries typically given for polling data. Specifically, the following is the key to a good poll: Random sampling with the same statistics as the base group. Unbiased poll workers, who will not influence the outcomes Truthful answering of questions. The person being asked will not change their mind between now and the real vote. Assuming that these are true, then we fall into the realm of sampling statistics. The general formula is sqrt((p-p^2)/n). Assuming that the race is nearly split, then this gives sqrt(.25/n), or 1/(2*sqrt(n)). Again, for the random sample of 1000, this will let you know how accurate one portion of the numbers is. Dividing it by the half of the full body, and you get 3.4%. If these are not true, then some corrective factor could be applied to the poll. This is where things get tricky. Most polls are conducted via phone. For those who do not have access to phones, this will skew the data. What is typically done to correct for these is to gather additional information about the person being polled, and correcting the overall data to better fit the model of who is actually voting."
49,Has range voting been successfully implemented anywhere?,NEUTRAL,"To improve upon traditional democracy, various alternatives to the normal up down voting have been put forth such as range voting. (Range voting is a voting method for one-seat elections under which voters score each candidate, the scores are added up, and the candidate with the highest score wins.) For example RangeVoting.org describes how range voting could work. I believe that San Francisco has experimented with something akin to this for their mayoral races. What are the largest elections that have had some variant of range voting applied and how successful were the results? Were the constituents happy with the outcomes and did range voting remain in place or was it repealed?"

51,"",NEGATIVE,"The largest barrier to online voting is ensuring that fraud does not occur. Somehow you have to have a method to verify that a user has voted, and identifying that user, while not allowing other users to identify who you have voted for. Also, the method of counting the votes has to be similarly protected. Let me divide this into two portions. Verifiability of the voter: This is quite a tricky thing, but there is an analog to it already in place in mail ballots. Most mail ballots have two envelopes which contains the ballot. The outer envelope contains enough information to identify the voter. A ballot worker will take this information, verify the ballot, and then place the inner envelope into the ballot pool. So long as this is managed correctly, it would work. The analog to this in the digital world would be to encrypt your data first with a public key that only the election office can decrypt (Along with a salt to ensure your data can't be guessed via a collision), and secondly with a signature that you have voted, something that presumably would be mailed to you. Your vote is passed to a computer server, which verifies you are eligible, and haven't voted, which then passes the still encrypted vote portion on to a second system, which records your votes. Still, there is some inherit danger in somehow frauding this system. There are some systems which allow for calculations on encrypted data, but for the most part, these are not yet ready for prime time. Still, these would allow for an even more secure system, one in which all votes could be public, but no one would know who voted for who. Counting the votes. After you have voted, your vote must be counted. But how can you actually verify that the vote was accurately recorded? Paper ballots give real tangible proof that there is something, and are rather hard to discard. Also, the polling places must keep track of the number of ballots used, and return even blank and spoiled ballots. Digitally, it would be quite easy to miss some of these votes, and not count them. Of course, the counting time is quite quick. One could imagine a system of verification by randomizing a large number of votes that were known to go a particular way, and auditing the system, perhaps even on election day, to ensure the system counted correctly. Conclusions While internet voting would be a fantastic thing, and the technology is starting to come to fruition, it could be abused, and has thus been taking a slow route. I could have mentioned other topics as well, like fraudulent voting sites, etc, but sufficeth to say there are a lot of complexities, and people who would exploit them. Someday we will get there, but the technology just isn't ready yet."
52,Which countries outside of the U.S. already have Freedom of Information laws?,NEGATIVE,"Given that the U.S. has a history of Freedom of Information laws nationwide as well as statewide, I was wondering whether you could answer which other countries already have similar laws. Those can range from simple freedom of information laws to full transparency laws (e.g. Hamburg, Germany) At the moment the only other country I know of is Germany and there the law is not nationwide."

57,Does the Corporate tax rate negatively affect the economy?,NEGATIVE,"I've heard from many sources that the corporate tax rate has a detrimental effect on the economy, and that lowering it not only has the effect of stimulating the economy, but actually raises more revenue. Is this true?"
58,"",NEGATIVE,"Gerrymandering is surprisingly easy to avoid as long as the people in power are willing to make it that way, but if they're only in power because of gerrymandering you can have issues. Using a algorithm to calculate the lines is one way to do it, but not the only way and not necessarily even the best way (algorithms tend to happily do things like cutting a major city into pieces) I don't know that they're the largest, but several places credit Canada with having particularly fair districts. For example, here's Toronto: Canada manages this by leaving the redistricting to an independent body, Elections Canada. By \"independent\" I mean \"non-partisan\", which is very different than \"bipartisan\" and harder to achieve. Bipartisan groups (in the U.S., at least) have a reputation for maintaining the status quo by gerrymandering equally, so that both sides keep the seats they have forever. Independent groups theoretically have no such motivation, and will attempt to draw the fairest lines they can. Australia and the UK also use independent groups to handle redistricting, but it's less clear how successful they have been at avoiding gerrymandering"

62,"",NEGATIVE,"The advantage is that it prevents the party in power strategically choosing the election timing so that it advantages them. Now sometimes a party lacks the numbers in parliament for the policies it wants to pass, and parliament ends up deadlocked. If the term is fixed, it prevents the party calling a new election to let the voters settle the issues."
63,"What is the \"Fiscal Cliff\" in the United States?",NEGATIVE,"I've heard a ton of information on the Fiscal Cliff of 2013, and I was wondering what it is, and how it will affect the country?"
64,What inhibits a winning candidate from doing exactly the opposite of what he promised?,NEUTRAL,"In theory the citizens vote for candidate X because they share his/her electoral offers or promises, but sometimes those candidates don't do what they said. So my question is: What prevents a winning candidate to do exactly the opposite of what he said during the electoral race? The words are moved by the wind, I can say anything to win an election and do exactly the opposite after I take the power."
65,Does a quorum to enter parliament guarantee government stability?,NEGATIVE,An argument in favor of quora enforced during elections to enter parliament is that it guarantees more stability for the governing parties and thus for the government. I was wondering whether this holds true and if yes which is the minimum quorum for which this is true.
66,"",NEGATIVE,"The fiscal cliff is a series of automatic cuts specified by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as well as the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. The cuts affect a broad range of programs across the board, and are predicted by the CBO to cut the deficit in half, as well as send the United States back into a recession (Source). The Fiscal Cliff, much like it was created by congress in the debt ceiling debate in 2011, can also be repealed by congress. However, this repeal will likely only come when Republicans and Democrats agree on a package to reduce the deficit through revenue and cuts."
67,Why and how is the Vice President elected in U.S?,NEGATIVE,Why is the Vice President elected in the US? Why isn't he chosen by the President like any other secretary? Is there any important reason why the writers of the Constitution made that choice? How is the Vice President elected in the actual bi-party system? Is possible to have a VP from party B even if the President is from party A?
68,"",NEGATIVE,"Mandatory voting increases the impact of the moderate vote, as many moderates wouldn't bother to show up if it was optional. It also means that more effort is focused on getting moderates to swing over to your side, while in optional voting much of this effort is instead focused on ensuring your supporters turn up to vote (by demonising the opposition). It encourages the political parties to head towards the centre. There are frequent claims that poorer workers are afraid to leave work to go vote as they want to be seen as hard working. If someone doesn't want to vote, do they really care enough about the issues to have an informed opinion?"
69,"",NEGATIVE,"The Vice President is elected because it is constitutionally required, as per the 12th amendment. The reason the Vice President is elected is because, since the VP is first in the line of succession, and that is one of the VP's primary responsibilities, so it was seen as a position that should be elected. Alexander Hamilton outlines this view in Federalist No. 68: The other consideration is, that as the Vice-President may occasionally become a substitute for the President, in the supreme executive magistracy, all the reasons which recommend the mode of election prescribed for the one, apply with great if not with equal force to the manner of appointing the other. As for how, the electors in the electoral college cast a ballot for the president and vice president. Both votes are technically separate, though in practice Presidents run with a Vice President. As for the rest of your second question, before the 12th amendment, the runner up in the election was made vice president, so it actually used to be the norm that the two would be from a different party. Today, it would only happen in the case of an electoral collage tie, in which case The House of Representatives selects the president, and the Senate selects a VP."
70,"",NEGATIVE,"The process I am most familiar with is a recall election. The fact that a politician can be recalled should be grounds enough to discourage the type of behavior you describe. The details will vary greatly from country to country and from state to state. In the U.S., for example, it appears that the President cannot be recalled, some states allow US Senators and congressmen to be recalled. For info on certain states, see here for recalling local officials. In the case that something illegal has been done, impeachment is another option. In the US again there are certain powers given to each branch of government. If say the President oversteps his or her powers, impeachment trials could be held to remove the person from office. The point with both of these options is that they allow the offending elected official to be removed. The threat of that hopefully would keep them doing the \"opposite of what he promised\"."
71,What is the difference between parliamentary and presidential governments?,NEUTRAL,"What are the main differences between the parliamentary system of government versus the presidential system? For example, Germany's parliamentary system versus Mexico's presidential system. I'm particularly interested in the pros and cons of each."
72,"",NEGATIVE,"The original conception of the US presidency was very different than it is today. Originally, there was a pool of potential candidates selected, out of whom the electoral college members would vote for their two favorite candidates. The one with the most votes would be the most qualified, thus he would be the president, and the one with the second most votes the second most qualified, and thus the Vice President. The second president, John Adams, was elected, and his arch rival (at least, politically speaking), Thomas Jefferson, was the vice president. This didn't work very well, and in fact, in later days, the president asked the electors to vote for a second candidate alongside him, such that the two had similar views. Well, that also didn't work, leading to the 12th amendment. So, what does this all mean? For all practical purposes, the vice president is a historical artefact. Still, it adds another dimension to the presidency, and allows the voters to select not only the president, but the person who will fill his role if something should happen to the president. By the succession laws, the next person in line is the Speaker of the House, which is a semi-elected position (elected by elected officials from elected officials, plus being elected from their district), as is the next person, the President pro Tempore of the Senate. These two people have other responsibilities; namely, to lead the congress. Beyond them is the Cabinet. Personally, I would prefer to vote for them as well, but there needs to be some freedom in allowing the president to change these people around. The vice president has no official responsibilities in government, aside from casting a vote to break a tie in the senate. This person is literally a fall-back president. Thus, the people of the United States prefer to elect this person, and allow the President the flexibility to assign his Cabinet, who do \"real\" work. Note that these still must be approved by Congress, giving them a semi-elected role as well."
73,Why are those serving in armed forces prevented from voting in Hong Kong?,NEGATIVE,"According to Wikipedia, armed forces personnel are prevented from voting in Hong Kong elections: Any Hong Kong permanent resident aged 18 or above may register as an elector in the geographical constituency in which he/she resides, except those mentally incapacitated and those serving in an armed force. What are the reasons behind their ineligibility?"
74,"",NEGATIVE,"The major difference between these two systems is that in a Presidential system, the executive leader, the President, is directly voted upon by the people (Or via a body elected specifically for the purpose of electing the president, and no other purpose), and the executive leader of the Parliamentary system, the Prime Minister, is elected from the legislative branch directly. In the Presidential System, it is more difficult to enact legislation, especially in the event that the President has different beliefs than the legislative body. The President only responds to the people, the legislative branch can't really do anything to threaten the President. As a result, he can make it more difficult for the legislative body to do anything. In the Parliamentary system, if the Parliament doesn't like the Prime Minister, they can cast a vote of no confidence and replace him. This tends to make the executive leader subservient to the Parliament. Bottom line is, if you believe that government should have more checks and balances, then a Presidential system will give you that. If you believe that it should have the power to enact laws quickly, then you should go for a Parliamentary system."
75,Why do the supreme court justices have a life term period?,NEGATIVE,"The justices of the Supreme Court of the United States is composed by chief justices which have a life-term period on that position after they are \"elected\". I have always asked to myself why some positions are by life-term, is there any reason like avoid corruption?"
76,"",NEGATIVE,"The reason that Supreme Court Justices(not just the chief justice, which is the head of the court) serve a life term is so that they do not have to worry about being thrown out of the court after making a decision. The idea is that judges should be able to rule without regards to public opinion, because they are meant to interpret The Constitution, not public opinion."
77,"",NEGATIVE,"(You've got some terminology confusion: the Chief Justice is the head of the court, the rest are just \"justices\") When the Constitution was being written the framers were used to Great Britain's monarchy, and were somewhat eager to limit the monarch's (in the case of the U.S., the executive branch's) power. The U.S. government places a high value on checks and balances between the branches, and the English notion of the king arbitrarily firing a judge he didn't like was problematic. In the Federalist Papers #78, Hamilton wrote: The standard of good behavior for the continuance in office of the Judicial magistracy, is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of Government. In a monarchy, it is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the Prince; in a republic it is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body. And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any Government, to secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws. In short, the court is around to make sure the other branches don't decide to start eliminating fundamental rights Furthermore, term limits mean there's more pressure to keep the people happy; even if justices aren't directly elected like many other politicians, the opinion of the country will have a big impact on whether or not they keep their seats. From the same paper: This independence of the Judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals, from the effects of those ill humors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particular conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the People themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information, and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the mean time, to occasion dangerous innovations in the Government, and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community. Though I trust the friends of the proposed Constitution will never concur with its enemies, in questioning that fundamental principle of republican Government, which admits the right of the People to alter or abolish the established Constitution, whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness, yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that the Representatives of the People, whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents, incompatible with the provisions in the existing Constitution, would, on that account, be justifiable in a violation of those provisions; or that the Courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape, than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the Representative body. Until the People have, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed the established form, it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually; and no presumption, or even knowledge of their sentiments, can warrant their Representatives in a departure from it, prior to such an act. But it is easy to see, that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the Judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution, where Legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of the community. Which I would interpret to mean: justices shouldn't need to fear for their jobs every time they make a decision that might be unpopular, even if it's in the country's interests long term, because most judges won't have the nerve to do what's right As a sidenote, the notion of life appointments for Supreme Court justices hasn't been without controversy, particularly of late. Increased life expectencies means justices have been serving for longer than ever before, and some people feel that the checks against the judicial branch is considerably weaker than the other branches. Term Limits for the Supreme Court: Life Tenure Reconsidered proposed 18-year term limits, staggered so a new justice is appointed every two years. The Supreme Court Renewal Act proposed the same scheme"
78,"",NEGATIVE,"With direct democracy, decisions are made by the people. Now, legislation passed by parliament is typically extremely complex. Most people don't have the time nor the inclination to read a 50 page bill, so they'll just go off what other people tell them. Even if the issue is stated in only a sentence or two, most people aren't going to bother to read up about the issue. Politicians have more time, more education and more experience than the population on average, so they should be able to make better decisions. Unfortunately, the political process can become affected by money, where someone's sponsors or the power brokers within the party, insist on policies that benefit them or don't represent the will of the people. Politicians can be overly affected by vocal minorities - sometimes the decision that causes 5% of people not to vote for you would be the best decision for the country (think for example people in an industry who want to maximise their conditions)."
79,"In the Electoral College, why can electors vote in contrast to their pledge ('faithless')?",NEGATIVE,"The United States uses an Electoral College system, where electors pledge to cast their vote in a particular way. However, these electors have the ability to vote in a manner that directly contradicts their pledge. What purpose is served by allowing for the possibility of a faithless elector? Is this part of the system specifically designed to consider the possibility that an elected candidate could die before the elector is able to cast their vote, or is it intended to be the last check in the election process?"
80,What criteria does a US Presidential candidate need to meet in order to appear on the ballot?,NEGATIVE,"The eligibility requirements to run for the office of President are: You must be a native born citizen You must be at least 35 years of age You must have lived in the US for at least 14 years (consecutive or otherwise) Once a candidate enters the election, what criteria determines if the candidate is in fact electable enough to appear on the election ballot? Does this vary by state, or is there a criteria that all states follow?"
81,"",NEGATIVE,"While recall elections might prevent local and state government officials from doing the opposite of what was promised, promises are exactly that, just promises. The promises are free to be broken, but remember that very often candidates will wish to be reelected to their offices and that relies on citizen's opinions. Using the United States of America as an example, delegates/members to the House of Representatives are up for reelection every two years, simplifying the idea of how party politics works in the US (ie caucusing with the affiliate party), this leaves their jobs at the whims of the people. Thus should they ever hope to advance they will need to make sure to effectively pander and do the bare minimum needed to keep the promises. A counterpoint to that is that Senators often have more leeway to negotiate and compromise due to their six year terms. Many senators, such as Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California, often do not face contested reelection bids, allowing them to move across party lines and make fewer and less bombastic promises during campaigns. Very often, you see those running for Senate running on very vague platforms in contrast to Representatives who promise substantial things such as tax cuts and ending Obamacare. So the answer is that while there is no legally binding obligation to keep promises, Members of the House usually have to promise and appear to do more to keep those promises due to job security, in contrast to Senators who often make few promises and are laxer about keeping them. In the general answer then, it would follow that promises are kept to build trust for a given political party, thus consolidating party backers (voters) and creating a basis for a party platform. In this regards, renegades of parties often get around this broken promise business by jumping to a more established party, or by starting their own and hoping to garner support for it. Either way, breaking promises can be a quick way of killing a political career."
82,"",NEGATIVE,"It's essentially a remnant from a time when the U.S. political system worked differently. (Not unlike the Electoral College itself, according to some.) When the Constitution was written in 1787, information traveled much more slowly than it does today, and the framers believed that most people would not be well-informed about issues and candidates outside of their own state. Consequently, rather than having people vote directly for the President, they instead had people vote for electors, who would be prominent, well-informed citizens of their respective states. The idea was that people would vote for electors whom they generally agreed with and would trust to make the right decision. Electors would then use their individual judgment in voting for President. Obviously, this isn't how the system works today, but changing the Constitution is hard, so electors are still technically able to choose who to vote for, even though their names no longer actually appear on the ballot. Some states do have laws that attempt to compel electors to vote for the candidate they're pledged to, but not all."
83,"",NEGATIVE,"These are generically called nomination rules; the US calls them ballot access rules. They're entirely up to the states and can pretty much be anything, although unfair ballot access rules can be ruled unconstitutional (this happened in Tennessee earlier this year). In fact, the entire process of choosing electors is left up to the states, they just need to somehow choose the right number of electors and then have them vote. From the US Constitution, Article II, Section 1 (emphasis mine): Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress Currently all states except Maine and Nebraska use the same system, where all electors are supposed to vote for the plurality winner in that state's count, but states are free to choose electors however they want, so they don't even need to have a ballot in the traditional sense; as far as I can tell it would be legal for a state to decide the Governor is going to choose that state's electors and they're not going to bother with a popular vote anymore. This is what makes things like the National Popular Vote possible"
84,"In models of income distribution, is inequality a natural outcome?",NEGATIVE,"From The Oxford Handbook of Political Economy (2006): Two of the more influential papers that examine inequality within a median voter context are Persson and Tabellini (1994) and Alesina and Rodrik (1994), which both argue that greater inequality will lead to greater preferences for redistribution, and show a negative empirical connection between inequality and growth. The open question with these papers is whether inequality actually increases redistribution. Empirically there is a strong negative relationship between inequality and social welfare spending, which seems to contradict. While this negative correlation might reflect that more redistribution reduces inequality, it is also possible that more inequality leads to less redistribution rather than more because in unequal societies the poor lack the resources to push their political agenda. Are there models that account for the disproportionate amount of power of a minority? That is, how has the median-voter model been adapted to allow for different degrees of influence, and given such a model, is equality inherently unstable? Under what assumptions (of redistribution) would equality be stable? In particular, I'm interested in the dynamics of the system: if equality and inequality are both stable equilibria, what determines to which equilibrium the system converges? For example, if the rich can influence political outcomes through lobbying activities or membership in special interest groups, then more inequality could lead to less redistribution rather than more. According to this view, as the rich become richer, they acquire a greater ability to influence policy and achieve the policy goals that they want. EDIT: To give additional context, there are models based on complex adaptive systems such as the \"sugarscape\" of Epstein and Axtell (1996) that report: Under a great variety of conditions the distribution of wealth on the sugarscape is highly skewed, with most agents having little wealth. Highly skewed distributions of income and wealth are also characteristic of actual human societies, a fact first described quantitatively by Vilfredo Pareto. Although I imagine there are an infinite number of ways to model such a system, I'm asking for one that restrains itself to the rational agent model, could be explained mathematically (or as an algorithm), has been compared to empirical evidence (despite its limitations), and has been published in a journal or presented at a conference. I recognize there are cultural, and especially ethnic, aspects to inequality, but I am asking for a mathematical model."
85,What are the key factors for the rise of nationalism in Europe?,NEGATIVE,"In the past decade there has been a constant rise of nationalism in European politics, with nationalist parties gaining popularity in almost every member of the European Union. The canonical example is Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National in France, that won 15% of the overall vote in the 2011 cantonal elections, under Le Pen's daughter Marine. Other examples include: Greece's Golden Dawn entered the parliament for the first time in May 2012 Finland's True Finns won 19.1% of the vote in the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election While I understand that there each party may owe most of its recent popularity in localized, country specific reasons, there certainly seems to be a current wave of nationalism in Europe and I'm more interested in what the key factors for it might be, in a EU politics level. The European sovereign-debt crisis seems like an obvious explanation and it's indeed brought forth by several authors as the most important factor, but I'm not qualified to assess whether that's true or not, or if is as significant as posited.

Its military defence is currently the responsibility of a garrison of the PLA, inspiringly named the PLA Hong Kong Garrison. Members of the garrison are Chinese nationals, not Hong Kong nationals, and thus understandably ineligible to vote in Hong Kong elections."
87,What are typical consequences for a political party of losing an independence referendum?,NEGATIVE,"The signature policy of the devolved Scottish government's ruling party (the Scottish National Party) is that Scotland should be an independent state, separate from the United Kingdom. To that end, Scotland is gearing up for a referendum on independence, to be held in 2014. Opinion polls suggest that a majority of Scots currently oppose independence. What consequences have resulted in the past for parties (or other political movements) which promote independence referenda, but go on to lose them? Do they subsequently gain or lose popular support in such circumstances? Does the loss of such a referendum usually weaken the movement towards independence for a significant period, or can an approach along the lines of \"keep asking the question until we get the right answer\" succeed?"
88,"How does early voting work, and what are the pros and cons?",NEGATIVE,"During the last American presidential election, it seemed to me like early voting was getting more attention than in previous campaigns. The Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, even voted early himself (which is a first ever, apparently). From the outside looking in, it was quite confusing. There seemed to be states in which it was more of an issue than others. Is this a state-regulated concept? Did the individual states conceive the system, or is it an optional procedure of elections? Is there a maximum to the period of time that can be reserved for voting early? There seemed to be quite a bit of opposition to the concept as well. Here in Europe, the political talkshows presented it as a boost for Democratic votes, as the Democrats tend to have a lower participation ratio on voting day. Is this the main reason? And is that why the GOP is/was often heard opposing early voting? This led to me wondering what some of the arguments are, both pro and against being allowed to vote early."
89,"",NEGATIVE,"There are four correct answers to this question, here presented in increasing relevance: If you look at the US debt in dollar terms, the last president to reduce debt over one fiscal year was Eisenhower, who did reduce debt in the two fiscal years 1955-1957. However, during his two terms, debt increased with more than 20 billion dollars, and your question of \"Who was the last president to reduce debt\" probably is intended as a question of what president reduced debt over his presidency as a whole. So a more relevant answer is which was the last president to have lower debt when he exited office than when he entered it, and that was Warren G Harding, who reduced debt from 23,977 million dollars in 1921 to 22,349 million dollars in 1923. However, absolute numbers aren't that relevant in the first place, they aren't even adjusted for inflation. Adjusting for inflation it seems that the last President to have lower debt when he left office than when he entered it was Lyndon B Johnson, who had approximately 305 billion dollars in debts when he started, and 353 billion dollars six years later (I can't bother to find the monthly numbers for this). According to this site the 305 billion dollars in 1963 would have been 365 billion dollars in 1969, meaning that adjusted for inflation, Johnson reduced total outstanding debt. But even more relevant is how large the debt is as a percentage of the gross domestic product, as that gives you the most relevant information: How capable is the country of paying back that debt. And if you look at debt as a percentage of GDP, the last president to reduce debt was Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton started with a total debt outstanding (which includes intra-governmental debt) of from 4.2 Trillion dollars and a 6.5 Trillion dollar GDP to 5.7 Trillion dollar debt with a 9.9 Trillion dollar GDP. So yes, the claim that Bill Clinton increased debt is correct, if you look at the number of dollars. But as a percentage of GDP, which is the important value, he reduced it."
90,"",NEGATIVE,"People from the beginning were divided, at the beginning in small groups, then tribes, groups of tribes etc. Nationalism is the divide into the very large groups. The instinct to divide is bound with survival. When the amount of resources is limited, not everyone can survive so people divide into groups fighting each other for resources. It is not specific for people, but for all herd animals. Currently we have crisis, big unemployment (as compare to the state before 2008). So in fact, it would be suprising, if the popularity of nationalistic parties would not increase. In Europe, we have also the new form of nationalism, which was represented for Pim Fortuyn, for example. As opposed to conservative nationalism, this is liberal nationalism, which is based on assumption, that imigration from other countries, especially the muslim ones, would endager the liberal model and liberal values of Europe. We have also nationalism on the higher level, the economical nationalism of EU and US. EU is fighting against GMO to protects its agriculture and US propagate extended copyrights conception, which brings the most profit to the US companies. This is also motivated by egoism and the fight to have the most resources for themselves, while not being classified as nationalism by wide studies. But it is based on the same mechanisms."
91,"",NEGATIVE,"The crisis is one of the biggest fact that have increased the nationalisms in the politic field. People in more reduced regions are looking for someone that represents them having a better look at their area, their people etc. Let's take a look at the situation in Catalonia, Spain. With financial problems in all over the country central government has to take more resources of the richest areas, thing that has been allways unpleasant for catalan people, since there have been allways cultural differences. Now, appart from that, with a central government that wants to turn catalan, the cooficial language of the Catalonia, to the 4th language, the number of nationalists has increased and is increasing more every day. So what I think, is that it's more the feeling that they have to find out someone who really represents them, their situation and interests, normally not close to central institutions like UE or central government in Spain in the example of Catalonia. Update: To clarify the situation in Catalonia I add two articles of the New York Times explaining what happened in the elections and why they were tooken two years before because of the demonstration of 11th of September. 11th September: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/opinion/a-new-call-for-catalonias-independence.html Catalan elections: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/world/europe/divisive-election-in-spains-catalonia-gives-win-to-separatist-parties.html?_r=0 Article of Jonathan Hopkin – London School of Economics: http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/11/27/catalonia-election/"
92,"",NEGATIVE,"Early voting is a very simple process really, in its simplest form you vote a day early in designated early voting stations. Its purpose is also very simple, relieve crowding in voting stations on the election day, and thus increase participation. It's a practice that, in one form or another, is followed in several countries. In the US early voting is regulated at the state level, and not all states offered early voting in the 2012 election1. As for the controversy, it was build around the opinion that the practice would eventually favour the Democrats as groups that were more likely to to vote for them also tended to not show up on election day (for one reason or another). Some states offered early voting via mail, which clearly is more convenient for a lot of people: Another voter, Myrna Levey of Cleveland, Ohio, said she voted early for Obama, by mail through an absentee ballot. 'It's more convenient,' said Levey, 74. 'They moved our voting place several blocks away and it is no longer in walking distance.' Another part of the controversy was that the Democrats push for early voting, exemplified by Barack Obama's early vote, was mainly to counter-act a wave of recent changes in US voting laws, some (if not most) backed by Republicans, that introduced a number of restrictions, such as the voter ID laws. It has been argued that these changes were unfavourable for groups of people that traditionally voted for the Democrats: These new restrictions fall most heavily on young, minority, and low-income voters, as well as on voters with disabilities. This wave of changes may sharply tilt the political terrain for the 2012 election. Based on the Brennan Center’s analysis of the 19 laws and two executive actions that passed in 14 states, it is clear that: These new laws could make it significantly harder for more than five million eligible voters to cast ballots in 2012. The states that have already cut back on voting rights will provide 171 electoral votes in 2012 – 63 percent of the 270 needed to win the presidency. Of the 12 likely battleground states, as assessed by an August Los Angeles Times analysis of Gallup polling, five have already cut back on voting rights (and may pass additional restrictive legislation), and two more are currently considering new restrictions. From what I gathered the main arguments against early voting were: It allows otherwise inactive / uninterested voters to vote, Some states allowed people to vote weeks before election day, and those who took advantage of that voted without having all the information, The integrity of the ballot was questioned, especially for the states that allowed absentee voting via mail, and It wasn't worth the extra cost as studies have shown that it doesn't significantly increase participation (and it might even depress it). In my very humble opinion all the arguments, pro and con, are politically biased and the actual significance (if any) of early voting in the 2012 election is very much a matter of debate: The blizzard of numbers, of claims and counterclaims, can be so daunting it's tempting to just throw up your hands and decide there's no truth to be had, just spin. But an objective analysis of early turnout can provide valuable tea leaves for Election Day. In many states, election officials disclose how many Democrats and Republicans have voted thus far. We don't know who they're voting for, but in most states, this alignment is a good proxy for the candidates. (Then there's the mystery of those voters who aren't affiliated with a party. In polls, independent voters have generally favored Romney, leading his campaign to claim an edge in this category, but for the purposes of analyzing early voting it's impossible to tell.) It's important to consider which party has historically had the early vote advantage -- Democrats, in most states -- and whether early voting makes up a substantial amount of the vote, which varies from state to state. ... This analysis isn't conclusive; it's a faint clue at best. But with as much as 40 percent of the nationwide vote likely to have been cast before the polls open on Tuesday, here's what the early vote is telling us so far. 1 See: Early Voting Rules for a thorough breakdown of how each state handled early voting."
93,Why are political party memberships public in the US?,NEGATIVE,"It seems strange that a country like the USA that has anonymous voting has the government knowing if you are a member of a political party: \" In many states, election officials disclose how many Democrats and Republicans have voted thus far. We don't know who they're voting for, but in most states, this alignment is a good proxy for the candidates.\" Why is this considered acceptable in the US where distrust of the government is rampart (ie. no national government ID)?"
94,"",NEGATIVE,"It is important to note here that political parties in the U.S. are unlike political parties in most other countries. An important point regarding your question is that there is a form of affiliation unlike being a dues-paying \"member\". This sort of affiliation is declared with the same institution where one registers to vote, possibly even in the same process. (Note: wikipedia says \"in many states\".) This is relevant as the primaries in the state may be organized by those that also organize the actual election, but primaries actually determine the candidate running under the respective party label and may be restricted to voters registered for (a) the respective party or (b) at least no other party. I am also not sure whether this affiliation information is actually \"public\", but at least it is known to the election officials the same way it is known to them whether, for example, the voter lives in the north or south of the electoral district."
95,How is corruption measured?,NEGATIVE,"The 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index was just published and according to it, Greece has the dubious honour of being the most corrupted member of the European Union. Naturally this stung a bit, and I looked at the relevant Wikipedia article for an explanation of the methods used in the index. It didn't help much, most of the references aren't publicly available and those that are don't really explain much. The criticism section was a bit more revealing about CPI's methodology, but I don't know how substantiated those criticisms are. Could someone explain to me in layman's terms how corruption is measured?"

One such model to measure petty Corruption based on Inflation, is discussed [...]. (The latter contains a link that should probably point to an article entitled \"Obtaining a Driver's License in India: An Experimental Approach to Studying Corruption\".) As for the methodology of Corruptions Perception Index, a little digging on the Transparency International website leads to a \"data package\" including a \"Source description\" pdf mentioning 13 different studies as source, some focussed on corruption, some not, often relying on a limited number of \"experts\" (e.g. 2 per country for study 3, 4200 responding \"business executives\", apprently in total, for study 7) to \"assess\" (not: \"measure\") a question, sometimes longer and detailed, sometimes shorter (e.g. “Bribing and corruption: Exist or do not exist”) on a given scale."
97,What are the conditions and benefits of U.S. insular properties like Puerto Rico?,NEGATIVE,"I always wanted to know which is the legal status of the associated states of United States like Puerto Rico. Who is the state head, of this kind of territory? Why can't they vote for the United States President inside of their territory? How is their budget assigned? Do they receive federal help in cause of natural disaster? Are they allowed to receive help in case of economic troubles? Which are the differences between this kind of territory and a normal state of the Union? And more important in what part of the Constitution this system is allowed, and who invented it?"
98,"",NEGATIVE,"Who is the state head, of this kind of territory? The state head is the current state head of the United States, in this case Barack Obama Why can't they vote for the United States President inside of their territory? As the president is elected by the electoral college, which in turn is composed of a number of electors. The number of electors in each state is equal to the number of members of Congress to which the state is entitled. As Puerto Rico (as does Guam too) isn't represented in Congress, they have no electors and can thus not influence the election. So the question should probably be \"Why is Puerto Rico not represented in Congress?\". To that question one could answer that the territory of Puerto Rico is simply the property of the U.S. and not an independent body, thus it is up to the federal government if they grant any rights to the structure of Puerto Rico (as has been done in 1950). How is their budget assigned? The contribute and benefit to/from the federal budget of the U.S.A. and have their own \"state\" budget similar to the 50 states. Do they receive federal help in cause of natural disaster? Are they allowed to receive help in case of economic troubles? In 1992 then president Bush wrote a letter to all the federal agencies stating that they should treat the same way than one of the 50 states. As they contribute to the federal budget they do also receive help from it. The Puerto Ricans are also contributing to the social systems and benefit in case of need from them. Which are the differences between this kind of territory and a normal state of the Union? Puerto Ricans only benefit of the basic rights and have no representation in the US houses. They do pay all federal taxes but may be subject to local taxation too. They do also serve in the U.S. military branches. In principle the only distinction is the rights they hold vis-à-vis the 50 states citizens. And more important in what part of the Constitution this system is allowed, and who invented it? Constitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the Congress's plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution. \"The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States ...\" So nobody except the founding fathers invented it."

100,"",NEGATIVE,"Given that while an Ambassador is the formal representative of a State to a foreign government, if he is recalled the delegation (embassy staff et al) can remain at their post. Thus it is a purely political signal to show the discontent of a government with a foreign government. Citizens are not harmed as the representations (embassies and consulates) will remain working until they are explicitly closed. But this is independent of the recall of an ambassador. In former times recalling the ambassador was a way to guarantee that he could be briefed on current issues and go back on his post with new directions which were too sensitive to entrust to postal services. Nowadays this doesn't hold true anymore, so in consequence it is purely a political statement."

103,"",NEGATIVE,"To quote from my own answer on History SE, the terms \"left\" and \"right\" have no objective meaning in today's global politics (unlike their historical usages covered by other answers) - they are 100% subjective, AND extremely varied across polities even when attempted to be used objectively. To give some examples of complete inconsistencies: In post-USSR Russia communist hardline parties are considered \"Right Wing\" and pro-Western economically liberal ones (e.g. pro-capitalist) are \"Left Wing\". A somewhat related but separate problem is historical drift. As a classical example, originally support for laissez-faire capitalism and free markets were counted as being \"on the left\"; today in most Western countries these views would be characterized as being \"on the right\". Gay Rights are commonly considered a property of the Left Wing (and opposition to them Right Wing). Leaving aside the usual imprecision of lumping together people with diverse views with a simplistic label (\"right wing\" libertarians in USA are strongly anti-gay-discrimination), let's not forget that SA was strongly pro-homosexual all the way to the top (Rohm). Sturmabteilung wasn't exactly an example of what people commonly refer to \"left wing\", though technically speaking, being against the established order, they should be. Also, many Marxist/leftist governments (e.g. USSR, Cuba) were strongly anti-gay for a variety of reasons, some of which were... \"being gay is a bourgeoisie thing\". It's very hard to define \"Right Wing\" today, especially since most people referred to as \"Right Wing\" today not only have nothing in common with the historical origin of the term (French Monarchists after French Revolution), but don't have much common politically with each other aside from opposing some or all of the policies labeled \"Left Wing\", and even that for a wide variety of reasons. People lump together on the right anyone from staunchly anti-religious \"sex maniac\" Ayn Rand to \"Family Values\" Christian fundamentalists some of whom literally wouldn't agree with Randian Objectivists about anything other than statists/Communists being a common opponent. Even single-country party affiliations don't help much either, for a variety of reasons. \"USA Republicans are Right Wing\" is a nice soundbite, except you just lumped together Ron Paul, Pat Robertson, Martin Luther King Jr., Trent Lott and Abraham Lincoln. Again, not really all THAT much in common between the 5 of them."
104,"",NEGATIVE,"A model for such a complex problem would be difficult to find and would be riddled with problems. This is the typical problem when trying to place a scientific model to prove or disprove a politcal charged assertion is that political affiliations are called into question, and since we are all have opinions on matters of politics it is hard to find anybody who wouldn't have a conflict of interest in creating such a model objectively. With that being said here is a well known article from the American Political Science Review: Here From the article: When voters have both redistributive and insurance motives for supporting welfare spending, the effect of inequality depends on how benefits are targeted. Greater inequality increases support for welfare expenditures when benefits are targeted to the employed but decreases support when benefits are targeted to those without earnings. With endogenous targeting, support for benefits to those without earnings declines as inequality increases, whereas support for aggregate spending is a V-shaped function of inequality. Statistical analysis of welfare expenditures in advanced industrial societies provides support for key empirical implications of the model. It calls out the convential view here: According to the conventional view, a change in the economic environment that causes the income distribution to grow more unequal increases political support for redistributive policies. In other words, the public favors redistributive policies as the need for them increases. Although voters are assumed to care only about their own welfare, the result is a welfare policy that varies appropriately with the needs of the poor. In addition, if greater equality reduces the demand for redistributive policies and if those policies inhibit growth, then reduced income inequality promotes growth (Alesina and Rodrik 1994; Persson and Tabellini 1994). Conventionally one would assume that redistributive policies inhibit growth, and inequality increases redistributive policies, therefore income and political equality encourages strong economic growth. The more recent studies paint a different picture, that while income inequality encourages redistributive policies, it tends to greatly encourage social spending policies that benefit the employed worker, but greatly discourages social spending for lower class citizens who are not employed. For instance: High income and political inequality results in high support for unemployment insurance, workers compensation, and social security, however sees a decrease in support for welfare, food stamps, and public homeless shelters. This equates to the following opposing political arguments: Critics frequently view welfare programs as redistributive policies that distort incentives and reduce the efficiency of the economy. Supporters often argue, in contrast, that welfare policies provide insurance to all and enhance efficiency to the extent that the public sector protects against risks that are difficult or impossible to cover through private insurance markets. In fact, the policy implication of either view is not obvious. On the one hand, one might think that welfare policies are fundamentally redistributive but favor increased spending on the ground that the benefit of greater equality outweighs the efficiency loss. On the other hand, one might consider welfare policies as social insurance but think that the demand for insurance could be better satisfied by private firms. So the political argument is one where one side frames the welfare argument for public insurance to protect equality as acceptable despite loss of efficiency, while the other side frames the argument that it is a redistributive policy that is inherently unfair, reduces efficiency and could be better handled in a private market. Here is Figure 3 showing what the results of the model had found: Without going into the math and statistics behind this graph (it is pretty intense!) These are measures based on mean and median incomes to measure inequality, wages and welfare spending. One can clearly see there is a divergence from conventional wisdom on income distribution that as wages drop, support for benefits targeting those without income drops as opposed to support for benefits targeting those with income."
105,"",NEGATIVE,"\"Democratic\" is a very imprecise label. For example, USSR held elections every N years, and called itself a democracy, despite \"the people\" having virtually no power. Wikipedia defines Democracy as: a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Democracy allows eligible citizens to participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws. Note two things here: In reality, \"Democracy\" as defined here is an ideal that Simply Does Not Exist. Nobody ever has \"equal say\", for a variety of reasons. Like anything else, in reality there's a continuum, which, since we are dealing with humans, is messy and hard to pin down. The official definition is about an idea, not an implementation. Thus, elections, while one way of implementing democracy-aimed ideas, are not a requirement at all (for example, you could simply make every citizen vote on every political decision directly). Elections are about representative Democracy."
106,"",NEGATIVE,"A common definition is Karl Poppers, that democracy is system that makes it possible to get rid of a government without spilling blood. This is a pragmatic definition, and it makes United states a democracy no matter what objections you have of the process, but not South Africa, even though the process is democratic in principle, as ANC still rules. I think this is one of the few definitions that people of different ideologies can agree on, just because it's purely pragmatic and casts no judgement on how the system looks, only how well it works."
107,"",NEGATIVE,"To understand what the Congressional Caucus is it helps to understand the history behind this word that has its roots in early American history. John Adams was the first to use the term to describe a meeting of politicians in his diary: This day learned that the Caucas Clubb meets at certain Times in the Garret of Tom Daws, the Adjutant of the Boston Regiment. He has a large House, and he has a moveable Partition in his Garrett, which he takes down and the whole Clubb meets in one Room. There they smoke tobacco till you cannot see from one End of the Garrett to the other. There they drink Phlip I suppose, and there they choose a Moderator, who puts Questions to the Vote regularly, and select Men, Assessors, Collectors, Wardens, Fire Wards, and Representatives are Regularly chosen before they are chosen in the Town Source The word in Latin literally means 'drinking vessel', and the Caucas Club was a popular pub in Boston at the time. In other words, he was more or less describing them as a bunch of political figures who all happen to also be drinking buddies. Fast forward to today in United States politics and the term has a very similar meaning, a group of politicians that are generally friendly and agree with each other on most issues. Your caucus is the group where you are most likely to find political allies with when garnering support for a pet project, pork barrel spending or a bill that you feel very strongly for. While the two dominant parties are currently Republicans and Democrats in US politics, the caucus typically expands to include other independents or members of third parties that would most likely share the most values with your party. The caucus lines are typically demarcated between Conservative Right and Liberal Left with independents and members of third parties making the declaration of which side they choose either way. This declaration is important on Capitol Hill as it helps other members of congress to more accurately predict the outcome of any one bill before it goes to vote. This allows the Congress to save a great deal of time and be more efficient by not wasting time voting on bills that likely have no chance of ever being passed. Without independents declaring a caucus, they become a toss up and this reduces the efficiency of the US legislative process. EDIT: To answer what makes them different from the party themselves, it becomes evident once we get an understanding of Congressional rules. As per typical parliamentary style politics, the Congressional rules are formed with the assumption that there will always be two diametrically opposing sides, the Majority, and the Minority. Being in the Majority party grants the privilege of certain congressional appointments as well as other things. In a multi party system the many parties generally caucus together to make appointments as a majority. It is similar to the US caucus just on a much smaller scale as third parties and independents are an exception. This is why they will form a Democratic Caucus and Republican Caucus by name, however these are not necessarily affiliated with any one political party. An independent Bernie Sanders has left leaning political ideals and thus has more in common with the Democratic party than the Republican party so he chooses to caucus with the Democrats. Another independent Joe Lieberman has been known to switch caucuses or at least entertain the notion from time to time, starting out caucusing with the Democrats then later in his political career caucusing with the Republicans. Sanders however doesn't get nominated by the Democratic party nor do Democrats have an opportunity to vote for his nomination. Likewise the same could be said for Lieberman, he could caucus with the Republicans though Republicans in his district had no vote to nominate him."

How have the senate rules been changed to allow for a filibuster without continued debate?"
112,"In the U.S., why does the majority party in a new Senate session always approve the filibuster rule?",NEGATIVE,"In the U.S. Senate, the Senate rules apparently do not apply to the first day of a new Senate session until the rules are voted in by a simple majority. Given this, and that the filibuster comes from these Senate rules, why would the majority party in the Senate ever want to approve the old rules that include a provision for filibuster, since that generally only benefits the minority party? Yet, session after session, the filibuster is voted in over the centuries. How does the filibuster survive this process continually?"
113,"",NEGATIVE,"The following list from A Tale Of Two Health Plans: Romney Versus Obama answers this question pretty well. Similarities Both have individual mandates that impose a tax penalty on people who have the financial ability to buy insurance but don't. Federal penalties start at $695 annually, or 2.5 percent of income, whichever is higher. In Massachusetts, penalties range from $228 to $1,212, depending on family size and income. Both require health care \"exchanges\" (in Massachusetts, the exchange is called the \"connector\") designed to create a competitive health insurance market that gives individual and small business consumers a choice of private plans, rules that facilitate price comparison and plan transparency. Both leave intact employer-provided insurance systems — Medicare plans for the nation's seniors, and Medicaid for poor and low-income citizens. Both would fine companies that don't offer employee heath insurance, with exceptions for small businesses. Massachusetts requires companies with more than 10 employees to offer insurance; the national law sets the limit at 50 employees. Both provide subsidies to low-income individuals and families to help pay for health insurance coverage. Differences The federal plan has a stated goal of attempting to lower health care costs; Massachusetts had no such stated goal. The federal plan includes a patients' bill of rights, and provisions designed to promote public health. The federal plan includes the so-called CLASS Act, a voluntary insurance program offered to workers for long-term care in the event that they become disabled when they get older. (The Obama administration last week delayed the program's rollout because it isn't financially self-sustaining as designed.) The federal plan would expand Medicaid to cover poor, able-bodied adults who are not parents in addition to poor children, elderly, pregnant women and those with disabilities. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid coverage to more children. To pay for the new coverage, the federal plan imposes taxes on a variety of sectors, from drug and medical device makers to health insurers. Massachusetts relies largely on federal matching funds."
114,"",NEGATIVE,"It is true that at one point you did have to talk continuously to block a vote, but it hasn't been true for ages. Skip a few paragraphs if you don't care about the history: Originally, the Senate had a way for the majority to vote to end debate on a matter, by voting that it's time to vote (yes, really) on the matter at hand. In 1806 the President of the Senate (Aaron Burr) suggested that the Senate eliminate this option because it was hardly ever used. According to The Previous Question: Its Standing as a Precedent for Cloture in the United States Senate, Burr: mentioned one or two rules which appeared to him to need a revisal, and recommended the abolition of that respecting the previous question [the call to vote], which he said had in the four years been only once taken, and that upon an amendment. This was proof that it could not be necessary The Senate agreed and eliminated this option from their rules, which now made unbreakable filibusters possible; they didn't actually happen for a few decades. During WWI a Senate filibuster blocked one of President Wilson's proposals, and he decided enough was enough and moved for a way to override filibusters. In 1917 the Senate voted to allow cloture by a two-thirds majority vote (it was changed to three-fifths later). As a side-effect of this, there was now no need to hold the floor by talking, because the filibustering side can just vote against cloture indefinitely. They don't even need to be present, there just needs to be enough of them absent to prevent a cloture motion from passing; one representative needs to hang around to suggest the absence of a quorum, and that's it. There have been \"real\" filibusters since 1917, like Strom Thurmond's famous Civil Rights Act filibuster, but those were largely for show or to make a point. It hasn't been necessary to hold the floor by talking since 1917"
115,"",NEUTRAL,"There are a few reasons: @mmyers hit the nail on the head, in his comment above. Senators in the USA are long-living critters (*cough*Byrd*cough*) and they anticipate that throughout their careers, they may end up in the minority and want to have the filibuster. Some are simply conservative (not in the political orientation sense) and don't like to change the status quo. Some (okay, I'd be hard pressed to name one, but not impossible) actually truly sympathize with the Founding Fathers' original idea, one of the strongest among which was to escape the tyranny of the majority in political decisions - especially as espoused by James Madison."
116,"",NEGATIVE,"Disadvantages Legitimacy One of the major issues raised by people who are for mandatory voting is legitimacy, the authority the elected candidate has over the governed people. However, not voting has the same effect of casting a blank or null vote, which renders the legitimacy arguement invalid. Advantages You may obligate doing but not thinking. The State can only control whether a person did or not vote, that's it. All the talk about the importance of dedicating part of your precious time to choose the best candidate is just invalid. How can you prevent people from voting to the most handsome candidate or picking any other meaningless criteria? Better quality propaganda If the number of people who vote are reduced to those who are interested, the candidates are going to make a better effort than repeating pretty words such as: education, jobs, health, etc. They may have to actually show how they intend to solve these problems and even adress sensible issues such as abortion and legalization of drugs.

119,"",NEGATIVE,"The two-House system used in the UK Parliament is designed to allow both the common people (in the Commons) to have their say on matters through Parliamentary representation, and for the decisions made to be reviewed by peers (in the Lords). In this way the two-chamber system acts as a check and balance for both Houses. Common Features Most Bills can be introduced to either House, and most Bills pass through both Houses (sometimes more than once, should the Houses disagree on the Bill) before they go on to gain Royal Assent. Either House can propose amendments to a Bill. The Commons Members of the House of Commons are publicly elected by way of General or By-Elections and their role is to represent the people of their constituency. Members of the Commons (MPs) debate political issues and proposals for new laws. It is one of the key places where government ministers, like the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the principal figures of the main political parties, work. The Commons alone is responsible for making decisions on financial Bills, such as proposed new taxes. The Lords can consider these Bills but cannot block or amend them. The Lords Members of the House of Lords are mostly appointed. They include experts in many fields which are generally used to determine the feasibility of a Bill before them. The House of Lords complements the work of the House of Commons. It makes laws, holds government to account and investigates policy issues. The Lords used to have a veto to stop legislation from the Commons gaining Royal Assent. This was reduced by the Parliament Acts to the ability to delay a Bill by up to a year, although there are some types of Bills to which the Parliament Acts do not apply: Bills prolonging the length of a Parliament beyond five years Private Bills Bills sent up to the Lords less than a month before the end of a session Bills which start in the Lords This enables the Commons to 'force through' a Bill which has stalled by disagreements between the Houses. There are three types of Lords: Life Peers Appointed for their lifetime only, these Lords' titles are not passed on to their children. The Queen formally appoints life Peers on the advice and recommendation of the Prime Minister. Archbishops and bishops A limited number of 26 Church of England archbishops and bishops sit in the House, passing their membership on to the next most senior bishop when they retire. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York traditionally get life peerages on retirement. Elected hereditary Peers The right of hereditary Peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords was ended in 1999 by the House of Lords Act but 92 Members were elected internally to remain until the next stage of the Lords reform process.

120,"",NEGATIVE,"To add to Lennart's already great answer, there is a fifth \"correct\" answer to the question: .5. It is irrelevant. In USA, the budgetary authority rests solely on the Houses of Congress (House of Representatives and Senate). As such, no US President can increase or reduce debt. Only the Congress can. (obviously, the President can have influence on the budgetary process, being the head of his own party, but legally speaking, he does not change the debt). NOTE: This answer pertains to the original unedited version of the question which asked \"Who is the last US president to pay off debt?\""
121,"",NEGATIVE,"From Wikipedia: Observers have the right to speak at United Nations General Assembly meetings, participate in procedural votes, and to sponsor and sign resolutions Most importantly, it gives Palestinians access to other U.N. bodies like the International Criminal Court, where Palestinians could launch complaints against Israel. Example: Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Russian Parlament Mikhail Margelov felt that raising the representation of Palestine to the recipe a non-member observer state at the United Nations allows the Palestinians to file complaints and lawsuits against the “entity” in the International Court in The Hague. Margelov told reporters, “The General Assembly of the United Nations lifted Palestinian representation to recipe observer State is a member of the United Nations, a status that enables Palestinians to file complaints and lawsuits against military strikes Zionism to United Nations agencies of the 18, including the Hague tribunal.” (src) Moreover, pretty much everyone admits that - in practice - the vote amounted to recognition of sovereignty. Example: Reuters."
122,"To what extent has the idea of \"laboratories of democracy\" worked in the US?",NEUTRAL,"From how I understand it, the idea of \"laboratories of democracy\" in the US is that state and local governments can better experiment with policies than the entire country can. So we can see what works on local and state levels first before broadening the policies to a national level. That is the theory, how well does this work in practice? What are some good examples of policies that worked extremely well at the local and state levels that were then put into practice nationally and saw similar success?"
123,Why does Cuba have two presidents?,NEUTRAL,"I can see that Cuba has its own parliament system - National Assembly of People's Power.

How do their powers differ?"
124,Analyzing Governmental Debt,NEGATIVE,When looking at the Federal debt there are a lot of ways to interpret the data. You can look at the dollar amount which is currently ~16 trillion or you can analyze it as a percent of the GDP. Are there other ways of interpreting debt ratios than the two mentioned? Is there a best or standard approach when analyzing debt at a governmental level?
125,Has the FairTax ever been implemented anywhere on any scale?,NEGATIVE,"The FairTax is really a set of proposals through which all federal taxes are eliminated and a federal sales tax is implemented. In addition to this, a prebate is given based on the poverty level so that in effect no one pays sales taxes on basic necessities. Has this ever been implemented anywhere on any scale? If so, how did it go. If not, has anything ever come close and how did it go?"
126,"",NEGATIVE,"There are definitely other ways. As any time when dealing with time series data, a good analysis would be velocity - how fast is the debt changing, and what are the rates of change and how do THOSE change. Additional analysis is separating one-time expenditures from recurring expenditures (e.g. debt incurred as a result of paying for WWII is a one-time event, whereas debt incurred as a result of paying for government pensions is a recurring one). This is a difficult analysis since the debt is not directly attributed to expenditures; but the math can be done (it's done for performance attribution of financial portfolios). There are also non-financial facets of analyzing debt: Geopolitical implications (debt to China vs. debt held by US public vs. debt held by UK government). Debt reduction analysis with an eye on high level root cause (as someone wisely noted in another answer about which president had biggest debt reduction, very frequently the root causes of budgetary changes are inherited from prior administrations). For example, large scale defunding of military purchasing may reduce debt short term, but will predictably increase the debt later on when ramp-up is required."
128,"",NEGATIVE,"This was discussed on Skeptics.SE previously: Do tax cuts stimulate an economy? To steal from Borror0's answer (emphasis mine): Taxes do affect economic growth, but not equally. From the OECD paper, 'Do tax structures affect aggregate economic growth? Empirical evidence from a panel of OECD countries': The results of the analysis suggest that income taxes are generally associated with lower economic growth than taxes on consumption and property. ... Property taxes, and particularly recurrent taxes on immovable property, seem to be the most growth-friendly, followed by consumption taxes and then by personal income taxes. Corporate income taxes appear to have the most negative effect on GDP per capita. These findings suggest that a revenue-neutral growth-oriented tax reform would be to shift part of the revenue base towards recurrent property and consumption taxes and away from income taxes, especially corporate taxes."

131,Implications of governments borrowing from a central bank rather than issuing money directly,NEGATIVE,"Early in the history of the United States the political battle was fought between those who favored a strong central bank of the United States and others who felt the government reserved the right to issue its own currency (I realize this is a gross simplification, but let's limit commentary on my one sentence summary) The current model that is in place in the United States is one of a private central bank, The Federal Reserve, that mostly reserves the right to print national currency, with its board of directors being appointed by Congress. The Federal Reserve distributes money into the supply typically by either purchasing government bonds, or lending money to other private banks at a base interest rate (See Fractional Reserve Banking) When government intends to spend an amount of money they typically must acquire it by issuing bonds to a foreign country or by issuing bonds to the Federal Reserve for the cash that it prints. This inevitably ties money creation by the central bank to government debt. Government debt has become a worrisome political issue as of late. The current model is only sustainable and viable under constant economic growth, and seeing as how this is harder and harder to achieve in a quickly shrinking world, what are some of the arguments for and against the Central Bank and Fractional Reserve Banking in general? Also, can a monetary system in which the legislative body of a country commands the issuance of new currency be a viable alternative politically?"
133,Did any legislation ever introduce something like the Chicago Plan?,NEGATIVE,"The Chicago plan involves to impose a 100% reserve on banks, so that banks can no longer create money by lending out. Recently, IMF published a note called The Chicago plan revisited. I'm no economist and I haven't read the full 71-page document, but this Daily Telegraph article summarises: Specifically, it means an assault on 'fractional reserve banking'. If lenders are forced to put up 100pc reserve backing for deposits, they lose the exorbitant privilege of creating money out of thin air. (...) 'The control of credit growth would become much more straightforward because banks would no longer be able, as they are today, to generate their own funding, deposits, in the act of lending, an extraordinary privilege that is not enjoyed by any other type of business,' says the IMF paper. 'Rather, banks would become what many erroneously believe them to be today, pure intermediaries that depend on obtaining outside funding before being able to lend.' The US Federal Reserve would take real control over the money supply for the first time, making it easier to manage inflation. It was precisely for this reason that Milton Friedman called for 100pc reserve backing in 1967. Even the great free marketeer implicitly favoured a clamp-down on private money. The switch would engender a 10pc boost to long-arm economic output. 'None of these benefits come at the expense of diminishing the core useful functions of a private financial system.' Simons and Fisher were flying blind in the 1930s. They lacked the modern instruments needed to crunch the numbers, so the IMF team has now done it for them -- using the `DSGE' stochastic model now de rigueur in high economics, loved and hated in equal measure. The finding is startling. Simons and Fisher understated their claims. It is perhaps possible to confront the banking plutocracy head without endangering the economy. Benes and Kumhof make large claims. They leave me baffled, to be honest. Readers who want the technical details can make their own judgement by studying the text here. What the article doesn't address is whether any legislation has ever tried to introduce such a system. Has it? Would it be possible for a single state to do so, or could it only be introduces globally? This question is certainly similar, but I'm not sure if it's the same thing: Implications of governments borrowing from a central bank rather than issuing money directly"
134,What are commonly cited pros and cons of central bank independence?,NEGATIVE,"Googling central bank independence brings up a number of articles discussing central bank independence. In summary and in layman's terms, why would it be advantageous for a central bank to be politically independent? What would be the disadvantages? Do adherents or opponents of political control over central banks tend to coincide with traditional political ideologies?"
135,"Why is economic growth considered so essential, even in rich countries?",NEGATIVE,"Whenever economic growth as a percentage of GDP drops close to zero, economists speak of a recession or even a crisis. In political debate, the focus is quite often on economic growth; in most democracies, leading parties are more likely to win elections if the economy is growing and opposition parties are more likely to win if economy is shrinking or growing very little. Therefore, politics goes through great effort to get the \"economic growth\" statistic above 0%. Why is this exponential economic growth considered so important? Most countries in North America and Western Europe are already quite rich, and something like the Human Development Index tries to measure indicators of quality of life, rather than dollars which are just a method of payment. Is the government focus on optimising GDP just because it's easier to measure than a vague thing like quality of life, or are there more fundamental reasons for a society to try to maximise this quantity?"
136,"",NEGATIVE,"Similar to a taste from a well-mixed soup. You don't have to ingest most of the soup to figure out if it needs more seasoning. Proportions calculated from simple random samples are unbiased estimators of the population proportion. That allows you to say things like \"about 95% of sample proportions calculated from simple random samples of size 1,000 will fall within 3.6 percentage points of the true proportion of those who support Candidate A.\" As another, if you suspect support for Candidate A is 51%, you can calculate the probability of getting a simple random sample of size 523 where 250 or more respondents support Candidate A etc. A single poll cannot not really tell you all that much. However, a bunch of polls, so long as respondents are randomly picked, can tell you a lot. Even when individual polling firms are biased towards one candidate or the other, you can control for those biases in ways similar to what Nate Silver does. The only real problem occurs when polls systematically miss certain individuals. Caution: The \"margin of error\" and \"confidence interval\" are frequently misused terms. NB: Some time ago, I put together an extremely simplified note on this stuff."
138,Can the Chinese government system be considered a limited form of democracy?,NEGATIVE,"According to Wikipedia the Communist Party of China has over 80 million members. It is about 6% of the population! This is more than the total membership in many (or most) western democracies. I'm interested if there are any studies about the practical implications of such high number of party members. Can the Chinese government system be considered a limited form of democracy? This 80 million people can more or less influence the course of the party. Of course the choice is limited between options available inside party, but is it so different than in western democracies? Here we have also the choice limited to the few options given by the biggest parties. Of course it is hard to define the influence of the single person. But in both systems the most radical ideas are eliminated. This is, for example, introducing death sentence in Europe (though in many countries such as Poland the great part of society is for the death sentence, the majority of politicians is against and such idea is practically eliminated as an option). Many people whose political views are practically eliminated are calling the western democracy a despotic dictature - because in both systems they have no chance to turn their ideas in life. In the both systems the individual can only influence the course of politics, when his political views are in the range of accepted ideas. The radical ideas are eliminated can be realized only by revolution. So, considering the possibility of influence the political decisions made, are those systems so different or rather similar? Are there any scientific or publicistic studies and researches in that area?"
139,How would one explain the E.U. to a 5 year-old?,NEGATIVE,"As the European Union is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, it would be interesting to have an explanation of the E.U. which a 5 year-old would understand. Is there anybody who can give such an explanation/description?"
140,"",NEGATIVE,A group of countries that come together to discuss policies that can help people in their countries for the better and find ways that the countries can help each other out. That is quite basic (literally for a 5 year old) and quite naive but it sums up the EU in very simple terms.
141,"",NEUTRAL,"Your question is based on the assumption that the ruling party of China has some sort of internal democracy, and that therefore China would have a sort of limited democracy. However, the Communist Party of China is not internally democratic. It is controlled from the top. You think that the 80 million members of the party can influence it, but this is not the case. You are a member because it looks good, and gives access to government jobs, etc, not because you want to affect the party."
142,What are the conditions required for a territory to become part of United States?,NEGATIVE,"This question is very related to Commonwealth United States Insular Areas, where I asked in detail about the Puerto Rico (and other areas) situation. Now I am interested to know which are the legal requirements set in the U.S. Constitution, needed by a territory to become part of the United States with all the rights as any other State of the Union.

Clause 2: The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State. Bottom line is, Congress gets to decide, so long as they aren't taking land from another state. So, how does the process typically work? Note, some of this comes from this source. The proposed state votes on the matter. The proposed state officially petitions Congress for Statehood. The proposed state must make sure it is following the constitution for its government. Both the Senate and the House vote with a majority to accept the state. The president signs the bill. Now, what does Congress typically impose? Some population minimum Speaking English has sometimes been a requirement, to an extent.

But in general, there isn't a consensus on the issue."

Executive power is exercised by the British Government on behalf of and by the consent of the Monarch, as well as by the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland executive. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the House of Commons and the House of Lords, as well as in the Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The highest court is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The UK political system is a multi-party system. Since the 1920s, the two largest political participation have been the conservative-party and the labour-party. Before the Labour Party rose in British politics, the Liberal Party was the other major political party along with the Conservatives. While coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of parliamentary politics, the first-past-the-post electoral system used for general elections tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party such as the Liberal Democrats to deliver a working majority in Parliament. A Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government held office from 2010 until 2015, the first coalition since 1945. The constitution of the United Kingdom is uncodified, being made up of constitutional conventions, statutes and other elements such as EU law. This system of government, known as the Westminster system, has been adopted by other countries, especially those that were formerly parts of the British Empire. The United Kingdom is also responsible for several dependencies, which fall into two categories: the Crown dependencies, in the immediate vicinity of the UK, and British Overseas Territories, which originated as colonies of the British Empire."

151,Why was the Electoral College the system selected by the founding fathers?,NEUTRAL,What advantages did the founding fathers see in electoral college that made them pick it over other potential voting systems?
152,May the United States Congress remove any secretary?,NEUTRAL,Is it possible for a United States Secretary to be removed by the House of Representatives or the Senate?
153,"",NEGATIVE,"Not directly, as: Members of the Cabinet serve at the pleasure of the President, which means that the President may dismiss them or reappoint them (to other posts) at will. Nonetheless can Congress get rid of a criminal secretary via its Congressional oversight powers and by using the Impeachment procedure (cf Article 2, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution), but only if they are found guilty of some sort of crime. Impeachment is a two-step process. First the House of Representatives impeaches the official and only after that does the Senate try him. If found guilty by the Senate the official is immediately removed from his duties."
155,"",NEGATIVE,"Yes, but not just because they feel like it. Cabinet secretaries are civil officers, so they fall under impeachment rules. Article 2, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution says: The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. All impeachments require both Congressional houses; the House of Representatives impeaches the official, and the Senate tries them. I think historically it's only happened once to a secretary; William Belknap, Grant's Secretary of War, was impeached in 1876."
156,Why do the United States have voting districts?,NEGATIVE,"Why do we in the United States have voting districts? Wouldn't it be better to allow people to vote wherever is most convenient and then group relevant votes based on the voters' addresses? Since we have electronic polls, I don't think it would be too difficult to implement. If security is an issue, couldn't we just use extra long variable-length encryption keys that change every few seconds, along with server and host authentication? Wouldn't more people vote if they could just go to the most convenient poll?"
157,"",NEGATIVE,"I think what you're actually asking about are polling places, the location where you cast your ballot, not districts. These are typically preallocated to certain voters because of the difficulty in keeping track of who has voted. Your ballot can't contain your name because your vote is supposed to be secret, so to ensure that each voter votes only once and only registered voters can vote, each polling place has a list of the people eligible to vote there and can cross people off as they arrive. Allowing people to vote at any polling place requires that each polling place have a complete list of registered voters, and a way to stop you from driving from place to place voting over and over; they can't wait till later to sync up, since there's no way to invalidate your ballot after you've voted. However, with computerized record keeping this is no longer a problem, and indeed there are counties that allow voting at any polling place. The reason it's uncommon is just because it was so recently infeasible to manage, but I imagine it will become more widely available as we rely more on technology to handle elections"

164,Is there any mechanism in USA to prevent someone from voting by mail AND in person?,NEGATIVE,"Theoretically speaking, there are mechanisms that prevent someone from voting twice (you are only allocated to vote to one polling place based on your residence address, and that polling place has a name list where you sign off that you voted). Are there any mechanisms in USA in place to prevent a person from voting twice by voting early by mail and then going and voting in person? If the answer depends on the state, let's take NY, the home of SE the company."
165,"",NEGATIVE,"I'll quote my answer from a related question: When the Constitution was written in 1787, information traveled much more slowly than it does today, and the framers believed that most people would not be well-informed about issues and candidates outside of their own state. Consequently, rather than having people vote directly for the President, they instead had people vote for electors, who would be prominent, well-informed citizens of their respective states. The idea was that people would vote for electors whom they generally agreed with and would trust to make the right decision. Electors would then use their individual judgment in voting for President. There are two other things that should also be noted: The Constitution doesn't actually say anything about how electors should be chosen. This is left to individual states, which can use any method they want—and they don't have to hold a general election. Early in the country's history, electors in the majority of states were chosen by vote of the state legislature, not by the people directly. Gradually, direct election became the norm. Under the Constitution, if no single candidate wins a majority of electoral votes, the President is chosen from among the top three candidates by vote of the House of Representatives, \"the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote.\" The framers did not anticipate the formation of a two-party system, so it may have been thought that this outcome would be typical rather than extraordinary. In that case, the Electoral College would have been a system for nominating presidential candidates, with the House actually choosing the President. In short, the Electoral College was designed to balance the desire for a democratically elected executive with the distrust of the common people held by some of the framers."
167,Did Plato's The Republic influence any of the 20th century's despotic regimes?,NEGATIVE,"Did Plato's The Republic and the ideas presented in it have any practical influence on any of the 20th century's despotic regimes? The idea of despotism of the wisest, those that know better than the rest of the society, would probably be very appealing to ruling parties. Karl Popper called the Plato the enemy of the open society. The idée fixe of Pol Pot was to create the ideal society based on the ideals invented by himself. The idea of separating children from parents have arisen again in works of 19th century precursors of communism. So, were some of the modern dictators fascinated by Plato's idea and wanted to turn them into life, or is The Republic just based on the ideas that are existing in the human soul? Are there any studies or articles in that area?"
168,"",NEGATIVE,"Yes, there are mechanisms of varying effectiveness. For example, in California, when you apply for an absentee ballot, your name is removed from the list of voters at the polling place. However, you may apply for an absentee ballot up to one week before the election -- which seems to be the standard for all states which I found information for, so far. By that time, the local lists seem to have been printed, because my uncle's name was still at the polling place (I checked) the first time he voted by mail. If he had wanted to, he could have also voted in person. Now, this part of California uses a paper (Scantron) ballot with individual serial numbers. So, theoretically, an official could cross-reference the sign-in paper and see that the same voter ID voted both ways. This would be an intensive manual process, and I could find no evidence that it was ever done. So, yes, there are mechanisms. And they do vary from State to State, and possibly county to county. For example, Oregon and Washington-state conduct all voting by mail. Of course, in many states, there is little to prevent a person from registering twice with different names -- once for an absentee ballot and once for a normal ballot. You would only supply your driver's license or social-security number for one application. States like California allow no-ID registration(PDF doc), but you are supposed to then provide this ID at the polling place. (Except that ID is otherwise not required at the polling place.) Officials could eventually discover that the same ID has voted twice. But, because there is an \"air gap\", manual correlation process, the odds of pulling off the fraud are good. I could find no record of my county's officials doing routine audits for this kind of double voting."
169,"",NEGATIVE,"Karl Popper may have been extremely critical of The Republic, but in order to do so he first took the position that The Republic is reflecting Plato's own philosophical views, and not those of Socrates. That might be a valid approach to the Socratic problem, but the separation conveniently frees Popper of having to deal with the fact that the majority of the Socratic corpus and Socrates' life aren't exactly compatible with the ideals of a philosopher king. The Republic is an incredibly complex work of philosophy1, and thus quite open to interpretation. Naive readings of are certainly attractive to people or groups of people who see themselves as virtuous guardians, and even more attractive to people actively looking for renowned philosophical works with (even superficial) parallels to their own ideology, to base their propaganda upon. In the Republic, Plato presents five different regimes, in order of preference, or more accurately in order of degeneration: Aristocracy, which the Republic advocates for, Timocracy, Oligarchy, Democracy, and Tyranny. Ignoring (for the moment) the fact that tyranny is at the end, Plato's aristocracy is technically a meritocracy, with some novel ideas for the era. For example Plato goes against the norm of hereditary citizenship and proposes that there's nothing that impedes a child to belong to a different caste than its parents. On the other hand, it's understandable how the fact that the middle caste's (the soldiers) main responsibility is to force the will of the philosopher kings to the majority would be appealing to despotic regimes. Plato's warnings against tyranny though seem to be wilfully ignored by, well, every dictator that came after him. Plato argues that the tyrannical man is the worst form of man, and eventually will lose his power and his life will be in constant danger. Even if the tyrannical man is not killed, in revenge for his crimes, his fear will eventually consume him, to the point that he will end up self-imprisoned, afraid to leave his own house. The fact that the Platonic Academy produced a number of tyrants, many of who had direct contact with Plato2, should also be taken into consideration as a quality that a despotic figure would possibly find attractive. (all) That said, and unless a despotic figure directly acknowledges Plato as an influence, how are we supposed to know? Hitler's fascination with ancient Sparta, for example, can be deduced from his direct comparison of the German troops to the ancient Spartans, when he paraphrases the Epitaph of Simonides in Mein Kampf: Traveller, when you come to Germany, tell the Homeland that we lie here, true to the Fatherland and faithful to our duty. But even with a direct quote, how can we measure the significance of the influence? Especially when discussing people that in general tend to be on the... less mentally stable side. In any case, and to finally answer your question, there's at least one instance of a despotic figure directly acknowledging Plato's influence, Ruhollah Khomeini, who studied Plato and Greek philosophy in general in the 1920s. Wikipedia cites his first book, Kashf al-Asrar (Uncovering of Secrets), as evidence of a direct acknowledgement of Plato's influence, but I couldn't find a freely available English translation. Next best thing I could find was Khomeini's NY Times obituary: In the 1920's, Ayatollah Khomeini followed his tutor to Qum, where he completed his studies, worked as a teacher and became interested in Islamic mysticism and Plato's ''Republic,'' which may have helped shape his vision of an Islamic state led by a philosopher-king. 1 And perhaps even a musical work. 2 Even though Plato himself used the word \"tyrant\" pejoratively."
170,"",NEGATIVE,"The answer depends on the country. You appear to be in a country where this is a requirement. I am from a country where it is not. In The Netherlands, in national elections, anyone can vote anywhere as well. It's quite simple: every voter gets a single voter card with their name on it. When they go to a polling station, they hand in their voting card (and show their ID) and get a different, anonymous card in return. Then they go and cast their ballot at this polling station. Anonymity is guaranteed because the voting card does not end up in the booth. Note that in principle, whether or not someone voted at all is not guaranteed to be anonymous in this system, but it isn't either when a name is crossed on a list. I'm not sure if it's possible at all for this aspect to be anonymous, short of destroying all relevant information immediately after the elections. An amusing side-effect of that in The Netherlands, some municipalities actually have a turnout of more than 100%. In the 2012 elections, the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog had a turnout of 150.33%. How? Because the island has 761 inhabitants entitled to vote, but a grand total of 1144 voted on this touristic island. In practice, the liberty to vote in any place in the country means turnout figures are not very meaningful anymore except on a national basis."
171,"",NEGATIVE,"The question of secession was resolved as a practical matter by the American Civil War, and as a matter of law by the Supreme Court decision Texas v. White, in which it was ruled that states cannot unilaterally secede from the Union and did not do so during the Civil War. The court did leave open the possibility of secession \"through consent of the States\", which presumably means it would have to be approved by Congress. This is extremely unlikely to ever happen."

174,Why don't British kings and queens veto laws?,NEGATIVE,"I've learned from Wikipedia that the British king or queen has the right to veto laws, but they don't use the right. Why is that?

I'm asking because the presidents of my country (who are however elected by the people) have an analogous right, and they use the right quite often."
175,Was the war in Iraq legal according to the US law?,NEUTRAL,Is it true that the recent war conducted by The United States in Iraq was undeclared and illegal? Have there been any rulings by the US courts on this? What are the arguments for and against the legality of the war?
177,"",NEGATIVE,"At no point in the Iraq War (or the Korean War, or the Vietnam War) did Congress issue a formal declaration of war. This is not unusual in present times; there have been only five wars (1812, Mexican-American, Spanish-American, WWI, and WWII) in which the U.S. actually did declare war. Although Congress did not declare war, it did authorize the President to send the U.S. military into Iraq by passing a joint resolution. The idea that Congress can authorize a de facto war without formally declaring one is generally accepted; someone tried to challenge it in Doe v. Bush shortly before the invasion of Iraq, but the courts refused to hear the case. Use of military force without Congressional authorization is a far more contentious issue, but this did not happen during the Iraq War. This also doesn't get into the question of whether the Iraq War was legal under international law, which is also hotly debated."
178,"",NEGATIVE,"When the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 was challenged in court, it was determined to be legal. The final resolution came when the case was dismissed in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, when the court decided that they cannot intervene: In this zone of shared congressional and presidential responsibility, courts should intervene only when the dispute is clearly framed. See Nixon, 506 U.S. at 228-29; Baker, 369 U.S. at 217. An extreme case might arise, for example, if Congress gave absolute discretion to the President to start a war at his or her will. Cf. Clinton, 524 U.S. at 423, 425 (describing President's broad explanations for use of cancellation authority). Plaintiffs' objection to the October Resolution does not, of course, involve any such claim. Nor does it involve a situation where the President acts without any apparent congressional authorization, or against congressional opposition. Internationally, (then) UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the war illegal: When pressed on whether he viewed the invasion of Iraq as illegal, he said: \"Yes, if you wish. I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter from our point of view, from the charter point of view, it was illegal.\" Mr. Annan's opinion is in no way binding to the US, but it has been brought forth as an argument against the legality of the war. That said the UN hasn't (to date) formally challenged the legality of the war, a process that would have to go through its Security Council, to which the US have veto power on."
179,How does Social Security work in the United States?,NEUTRAL,"There are political discussions in the United States regarding whether Social Security is maintainable over time. I want to know how the Social Security system works in United States, and what the basis is of the concerns about its maintainability."
180,"",NEGATIVE,"Article I, Section 8, of the USA Constitution says Congress shall have the power \"To declare War\", but the constitution does not specify how it must be \"declared\". For example, it does not say \"By law\" as is explicitly mentioned for several of Congress's other powers. According to Wikipedia, only 5 USA wars have been formally declared by a law that uses \"Declaration of War\" in the title. The last one was WWII. However, this is not required, and Congress authorized the Iraq war with Public Law 107-243. The war authorization was upheld by federal courts with Doe v. Bush, 323 F.3d 133."
181,"",NEGATIVE,"Australia gets economic benefits inherent with hosting a military base Even the opponents of the base (Australian Green Party) admit that: The economic benefits of military bases include employment for local contractors and suppliers. military benefits of both joint training exercises better security, especially in light of much stronger Chinese geopolitical weight and power projection, coupled with Japanese resurgence as maritime power - the latter is a very long term concern, granted, but some people still remember the meaning of Greater East-Asian Co-Prosperity Zone. USA gets a base in an important strategic location, in an extremely friendly territory, close to South-East Asia (next door to both Philippines and Indonesia, both countries with Islamist and Al-Quaida franchise presence) and closer to China. This is in line with Obama Administration announced 2011 strategic pivot to interests in Asia-Pacific region. A pretty good list of strategic implications and benefits can be found in this comprehensive article by Gordon Arthur. This is extremely important in light of issues inherent in stationing and basing in Islamic countries (if you recall, Osama Bin Laden's main original stated beef with the USA - outside of their support for House Saud - was the US forces based in Saudi Arabia)"
182,"",NEGATIVE,"The monarch of the United Kingdom is, as are most contemporary monarchies, a historical artefact, with little (if any) political power, their role is largely ceremonial. Refusal of royal assent is rarely exercised any more, and the main reason is, as you suspected, respect for democracy. Conversely, the last time royal assent was refused in the UK was in 1708, when Queen Anne vetoed the Scottish Militia Bill. Elected officials, on the other hand, are not going against democratic structures if they exercise their veto powers."
183,"",NEGATIVE,"Cuba does not have two presidents in the sense the term is usually understood. Off my head I cannot think of any country that does. Cuba has one head of state, the president of the Council of State, which as of this writing is Raul Castro. In countries with a parliament, it is not uncommon to elect or name one person to be the head of this body (off my head, I cannot think of one that does not). This title for this role may differ, e.g. \"speaker\" (UK House of Commons / House of Lords, U.S. House of Representatives) or \"president\" (see also \"President pro tempore\" of the U.S. Senate). Using the latter title in no way implies that the holder of this office has the same or similar role as the president of a country. Germany, for example, has a \"Bundespräsident\", who is the (figure-)head of the federal state, a \"Bundestagspräsident\" elected by the members of the lower house (Bundestag) usually for its whole term. Then each of the 16 states' governments is lead by a \"Ministerpräsident\", on of which also heads the states' representative body and thus is also \"Bundesratspräsident\" (rotating, changing every 6 months), who may also fill in for the actual Bundespräsident shall he (always he, so far) be incapable or the office be vacant. Summing up, the constitution of each country usually defines who is the head of state and who is the head of government, whether these are different offices at all and whether any of them shall be called \"president\". This in no way prevents other institutions to have an office also named president. As for \"How do their powers differ?\": Obviously, one heads the government and one the pariament. The actual powers in the case of Cuba are enumerated (like in most countries, I suspect) in the constitution; see especially articles 81 and 93."
184,"",NEGATIVE,"First, the formal basic information on how Social Security works: Informally, it's very simple from the view of an individual: A portion of your income is mandatorily taxes (FICA tax), with the proceeds used to fund the Social Security fund. Once a person reaches eligibility to be paid Social Security (usually specific age), they receive payments from that fund. The system was designed and tuned so that, on average, given how many people work, how much they make, how long they are expected to live after they retire, and how much the population grows, on average, more money is expected to be collected in FICA taxes than expected to be paid out to retirees. Here's a bit more on how Social Security formally works - this seems to be fairly comprehensively answered on Wikipedia, especially Current Operation section In the United States, Social Security refers to the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) federal program. Financing: Social Security is primarily funded through dedicated payroll taxes called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA). ... The FICA taxes are imposed on all workers and self-employed persons. Employers are required to report wages for covered employment to Social Security ...employers deduct these payroll taxes from workers' wages before they are paid. Generally, the payroll tax is imposed on everyone in employment earning 'wages' ... and also taxes net earnings from self-employment. Trust fund: Social Security taxes are paid into the Social Security Trust Fund maintained by the U.S. Treasury... Current year expenses are paid from current Social Security tax revenues. [ This is critical to understanding the problem - DVK] When revenues exceed expenditures, as they did between 1983 and 2009, the excess is invested in special series, non-marketable U.S. Government bonds, thus the Social Security Trust Fund indirectly finances the federal government's general purpose deficit spending. The Social Security Administration's authority to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, i.e., redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities. Therefore, Social Security's ability to make full payments once annual benefits exceed revenues depends in part on the federal government's ability to make good on the bonds that it has issued to the Social Security trust funds. As with any other federal obligation, the federal government's ability to repay Social Security is based on its power to tax and borrow and the commitment of Congress to meet its obligations. Now, for the maintainability problem. The short short version: Social Security is a closed system. E.g., it can not pay out benefits above the money that it owns. Its ONLY revenue source is FICA taxes (as far as accounting, the bonds purchased for surplus collection are also considered revenue, but in reality they are simply prior years' unspent FICA taxes). As noted at the very beginning, the FICA taxes and benefit eligibility was designed with very specific demographic and economic assumptions, to make the system sustainable. Currently 2 of the main assumptions no longer hold true: the # of years that benefits are paid out per person increased dramatically due to average life span increase in USA the amount of the workforce compared to amount of people in retirement is starting to drop precipitously due to Baby Boomer generation unwisely having chosen to have significantly fewer children than SS models anticipated). So, once we have 'too many' Baby Boomers retired and drawing SS benefits, for 'too many' years, with 'too few' - relative to that - people paying FICA taxes - there eventually simply won't be enough money in the system to pay all of the promised benefits, without additional sources of revenue. (where 'too' refers to assumptions made when original SS system was calibrated) Somewhat controversially, Social Security can be envisioned as a giant Ponzi scheme (marketing pyramid). Here's how it works. Let's assume, for ease of modeling, that a human being lives for 3 years: 1 year childhood 1 year working adulthood (Children are born when you turn 1 year old) 1 year retirement. We start with a population of 4 people called generation #1 (aka G#1) - split into married couples, aged 1 (they can start work), another 4 people called Generation #0, aged 2 (retired), and an empty fund. Everyone working earns $100 a year, pays 50% FICA tax. Every retiree gets $50 Social Security a year. The math works out the same as real life, just easier to calculate. We use 50% because in real life, a lot more people are working than getting SS due to the difference between retirement longevity vs. work longevity. Here's what happens: Year 0. SSTF balance = $0 Year 1. 4 people from G#1 work for a year. They pay $100 * 4 * 50% = $200 They give birth to 2 children per couple (4 total) of G#2. 4 retired people get their SS checks for $50 each, for $200 total. End of year SS Trust Fund balance: $0 + $200 - $200 = $0. Now, here's the interesting part to show the actual mechanics. Each bill we collected in taxes into the trust fund has a post-it not attached, with the year it was collected. Notice that G#1 people got their SS paid by bills collected from G#0. Year 2. 4 people from G#2 work for a year. They pay $100 * 4 * 50% = $200 They give birth to 3 children per couple (6 total) of G#3. Yay for Baby Boomers! 4 retired people from G#1 get their SS checks for $50 each, for $200 total. End of year SS Trust Fund balance: $0 + $200 - $200 = $0. Notice that G#1 people got their SS paid by bills collected from G#2! This is super-important! People in G#1, when they retire, are NOT paid by the money they paid into the system as a FICA! They are paid out of the money that the next generation pays right now, while they are retired!. Also note how everything is in perfect balance. Our 50% FICA tax was designed so that we have as much money coming in as paying out. Now, let's see what happens when you start modeling population changes... Year 3. 6 people from G#3 work for a year. They pay $100 * 6 * 50% = $300 But the Baby Boomers like their creature comfort, and 2 of the couples only have 1 child each. G#4 has 4 people. 4 retired people from G#2 get their SS checks for $50 each, for $200 total. End of year SS Trust Fund balance: $0 + $300 - $200 = $100. We are in surplus! Notice that G#2 people got their SS paid by bills collected from G#3! And since G#2 had more kids than 2, the SS fund now has extra money. Year 4. 4 people from G#4 work for a year. They pay $100 * 4 * 50% = $200 They give birth to 1 child per couple (2 total) of G#5 . 6 retired people from G#3 get their SS checks for $50 each, for $300 total. End of year SS Trust Fund balance: $100 + $200 - $300 = $0. We ATE the surplus! Notice that G#3 people got their SS paid by bills collected from G#4! And since G#3 had LESS kids than 2, the SS fund's extra money was spent right out. Year 5. 2 people from G#5 work for a year. They pay $100 * 2 * 50% = $100 They give birth to 2 children per couple (2 total) of G#6. 4 retired people from G#4 get their SS checks for $50 each, for $200 total. End of year SS Trust Fund balance: $0 + $100 - $200 = -$100. WE JUST RAN OUT OF MONEY, because the next level of Ponzi pyramid did not have enough people. Your Social Security just went broke. Welcome to what will happen to 21st Century in USA, when all the Boomers who couldn't be bothered to raise enough children will all over the sudden retire, and live longer than SS-originally-planned in retirement years."
185,Has a libertarian party ever won a parliamentary election anywhere?,NEGATIVE,"Libertarian ideas seem to have a strong following in the developed world, but I've never heard of any libertarian party being in power. In Poland, where I live, the main libertarian party (which might be the only one for all I know) has been doing a really bad job winning votes so far. Has any country ever had a libertarian government? Have the libertarian ideas been put to practice there?"
186,How have greater than two party systems functioned in the past?,NEUTRAL,"An earlier question (Why can't voting be fair if there are more than two alternatives?) got me thinking. Are there any examples of governments where more than 2 parties have had major roles in the government for a decent amount of time (a half century say)? And, if so, what (if any) impact has this had on the government and it's people. The question I reference deals more with the theoretical fairness of having more than two parties, I'm more curious about the practice and its implications."
187,Are there any major parties identifying themselves with Rosa Luxemburg's ideas?,NEGATIVE,"It's difficult for me to understand why I'm not hearing about any Luxemburgist parties. The ideas of Rosa Luxemburg seem not to have been refuted like some other branches of communist theory have in many people's opinion. Also, I do know that many consider Luxemburg a martyr for communism, which I would think should attract people to her ideas. So are there any major parties calling themselves Luxemburgist or embracing Luxemburg's ideology?"
189,Does Anonymous have a coherent ideology?,NEGATIVE,"The direct action group Anonymous has gained a great deal of attention in recent years as a result of its various \"ops\", usually targeted against governments and large corporations. However, because of its deliberately amorphous nature, claimed lack of leaders, etc., I find it difficult to get a clear grasp of its overall aims. Has any serious analysis been done of the (perhaps emergent) ideology of Anonymous? Can it reasonably be described as anarchist, anti-capitalist or something else? Is it even reasonable to call it a political movement in the first place?"
191,Are the viable political alternatives in the US (e.g. Democrats and Republicans) considered (far) left and (far) right?,NEGATIVE,"This question phrases the US political situation as: Today the federal government is in a seemingly interminable pendulum effect going between far-right and far-left. Coming from Europe and knowing US politics only remotely, I find this a very strange way of phrasing things. From my perspective, differences between the alternatives in the USA are very small indeed, where far-right and certainly far-left has absolutely no chance whatsoever, and everything tends toward the middle (or I might say to the right, but that could be tainted by my own political views). This XKCD infographic, however, also uses the phrases far left and far right, which makes me wonder if the terms have a different meaning in the US than they have in Europe. For me, far left is communism and anarchism, far right is fascism, racism and radical nationalism. Are any mainstream political ideas represented in congress considered far left or far right in US political terminology? If so, what are the meanings of far left and far right in the US?"
192,"",NEGATIVE,"Yes, there are many such countries in Europe and they function very well. Multi-party democracies are generally run by coalition governments. Usually, not a single party holds more than 50% of the seats in parliament as needed for decision-making. Therefore, two or more parties cooperate in a government, as many as are needed to reach the treshold of 50% of the seats. What parties can form a government depends on their programmatic differences. They might negotiate cooperation before, or only after the elections. For example, in The Netherlands, people vote for a parliament consisting of 150 seats. At the Elections of 12 September 2012, 11 parties got at least one seat in parliament. The smallest party had 2 seats, whereas the largest two parties had 41 and 38 seats, respectively. By comparison, in the 2010 elections, the largest parties had 31, 30, and 24 seats, respectively. Not any combination works, because parties may have great difficulties to agree programmatically. In the Dutch system, the largest party gets the head of government and gets the initiative to form a government. After the 2012 elections, it took 54 days for the two largest parties (centre-left and centre-right) to form a coalition government. After the 2010 elections, it took 127 days to form a three-party right-wing government. During the negotiations, the previous government continues as a caretaker government. A coalition government may be less stable than a single-party government, because as new events come along, parties need to agree on how to take care of it. For example, the coalition government after the 2010 elections broke down when they could not agree on how to fix the budget when there appeared a need for massive cuts, which was why new elections were needed already in 2012. Negotiations for coalition governments sometimes take a long time, because parties may be reluctant to give up electoral promises, particularly so soon after the elections. Yet this is often necessary, meaning there will always be disappointed people. This can be seen clearly in what happened to the two coalition parties in the opinion polls immediately after the government was formed: Dutch polls from peil.nl. The title reads \"Development of political preference in 2012\" The elections were in September, just after the big rise of the social-democratic PvdA (red dashed line) and the big drop of the socialist SP (red solid line). The coalition programme was announced late October, just before the big drop in the liberal (in the European meaning) VVD. It can be seen that the publication of the coalition agreement led to a big drop in VVD and PvdA (the coalition partners) and a major rise in the nationalist-populist PVV (grey solid line) and a rise in several other parties. This example is from The Netherlands, but most European countries are multi-party parliamentary democracies with similar (but inequal) systems. For example: Sweden has a 8-party parliament, but 7 of those (all but the extreme right) are divided in two major blocks, so it's effectively close to a two-party system. Switzerland has many parties, but its governing coalition hasn't changed for decades (perhaps because everything important gets decided in referendums). Belgium has the additional complication that parties need not only agree between left and right, but also between Flanders and Wallonia, leading to a record-breaking 541 days formation in 2010-2011. There are many more examples. An entirely different question is how the president gets elected in such a system. This is independent of the question of the government, but usually such systems don't have a president as strong as the one in the US. For example, in Germany the president has mainly a ceremonial function and is elected by parliament, and Switzerland doesn't really have a head of state at all. France does, and in France the president and government may not be of the same political colour, and consequently be constantly fighting. So, certainly multi-party democracies exist and are functioning to varying degrees. Stability may be less than in two-party systems, but that's not always a bad thing; it's relatively uncommon to see the same people in power for more than 8 years, new parties have a chance to introduce themselves into the political system, and minorities are represented when elections are proportional. In summary, it has many advantages."
193,Does any organisation refer to itself as terrorist?,NEGATIVE,"Does any organisation refer to itself as terrorist ? It seems to me this word is only used by political opponents to such organisations, as the term terrorism has a quite negative connotation. But I'm not sure if there are any historical or contemporary examples of organisations or movements referring to themselves as terrorist, or explicitly stating that terrorism is a suitable method to achieve their goals?"
194,What exactly formally constitutes recognition of a country?,NEGATIVE,"So, there is a spectrum of political entities that make up the national stage. There is, of course, the \"nation-state\" like the U.S.A, China, Russia, Germany, Lithuania, you name it - full fledged \"countries\" that nobody denies is a country. There are small states - Liechtenstein, the Vatican City, Andorra, ranging from protectorates to fully sovereign states that appear on any map with sufficient scale to warrant their naming. There are even failed states like Somalia, and one could argue Yemen, Sudan, Afghanistan have been in this category at some point. Not on this list, however, are some de-facto functioning entities like Somaliland, South Ossetia, Trans-Dneister Moldavia, and some would even argue Palestine. At least in the United States, these do not appear as sovereign entities on the map. (Note, I am purposely not including novelties like Sealand.) What does it take for a country to \"recognize these 'places that don't exist.'?\" Are there internationally set criteria that define what organizations and/or territories are \"nations\" for inclusion in the United Nations or for recognition by the most established players like the United States, the EU, China, and the Russian Federation?"
195,"Is there a link between political system and any of the various quality of life indicators, including environmental impacts?",NEGATIVE,"This question asks about the correlation between political system and economic growth. A similar but distinctly different question: is there any correlation between political system and one of the various indices trying to quantify quality of life? I'm thinking about: Human Development Index Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index Quality of Life Index Happy Planet Index Famously, the only country that has a high Human Development Index and a sustainable Ecological Footprint is Cuba: (source: Wikipedia) That would argue in favour of the Cuban political and economic system as far as the tradeoff between planet and people is concerned, but famously, one data point is not enough. Are there any more in-depth statistics trying to correlate (and study the reasons for correlation) between political systems, human welfare, and ecological footprints?"
196,Do scholars still use Mussolini's taxonomy of the history of capitalism?,NEGATIVE,"Benito Mussolini divided the history of capitalism from 1830 to at least 1933 into \"heroic capitalism\" (1830-1870), \"static capitalism\" (1870-1914) and \"supercapitalism\" (1914-?). Are this division, similar ones or ones derived from it used by modern scholars?"
197,How is constitutional monarchy perceived in Commonwealth realms other than United Kingdom?,NEGATIVE,"Especially in countries with huge population and economy like Canada and Australia, what's the opinion of people about constitutional monarchy? Are there any well known groups or indivuals who opposes to the form of the government?"
198,Do individual Commonwealth countries have to accept the new rules of succession?,NEGATIVE,"Roughly coincident with the birth of a child to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Parliament is set to make changes to the Act of Succession, allowing females to be directly in the line. The problem is that countries other than the UK have the English monarch as their soverign heads - including Canada, Australia, and others. Obviously, if they decided they didn't like, say, Prince Charles, I'm assuming they could disassociate themselves - but do they have any other recourse if they don't like the proposed changes?"
199,"",NEGATIVE,"A bill has to be passed in all commonwealth realms to allow the new rules of succession. All the countries have already decided they agree with this change but it needs to go though each country's parliament as a bill before it can happen. Should any countries disagree about implementing this change (which I doubt as it would appear extremely sexist to their populations) then either the whole thing would not happen, or more likely they would choose to/be expelled from the Commonwealth or step down from being a commonwealth realm to a normal commonwealth member."
200,"",NEGATIVE,Each country chooses which other countries it diplomatically recognizes. However a general and well-used way to establish whether it is seen in the international community is whether or not it is recognized in the UN.

201,"",NEGATIVE,"According to Steven Poole in his book Unspeak: (pp. 127-8): British Conservative MP Julian Amery, recalling his experiences in Britain's Special Operations Executive during the Second World War, said: 'I was a terrorist myself once. One of my duties was the recruitment of people to carry out terrorist actions against the Nazis in Yugoslavia and Albania.'3···3 Cited in Rees, Phil, Dining with Terrorists: Meetings with the World's Most Wanted Militants (London, 2005), pp. 15-16 And later: (p. 135): 'Terrorists' was once a proud self-description by those who committed political violence: as Phil Rees remarks in his superb Dining with Terrorists, 'The Russian revolutionaries who assassinated Tsar Alexander II and the French anarchists who manned the Paris Commune used the word with pride.'19···19 Rees, op. cit. Jonathan Barker's (very good, but not very well indexed) The No-Nonsense Guide to Terrorism has this: (p. 10): The conservative British politician, Edmund Burke, was among the first to use the terms 'terrorism' and 'terrorist'. He wanted to draw attention to the murderous excesses of the Jacobin state and its 'strong corp of irregulars ... let loose on the people', a perfect example of state terrorism using proxies. In the late 1800s Russian anarchists adopted the terms, describing proudly as 'terrorism' the stabbing, strangling or shooting of selected state officials. Since then few have claimed the labels; they have been reserved as terms of abuse to describe one's enemies."
202,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"The Monarch of the UK (and the Commonwealth Realms) is a ceremonial position and so she cannot, in reality, exercise this power. The only power I can imagine her exercising (beyond normal day-to-day duties such as awarding charters, awards etc.) is dismissal of government as that just means that another general election would be called. The problem being would be the vacuum for the interim government and the lack of time for campaigning. Refusal of royal assent (vetoing laws) would cause massive uproar and would show little respect for democracy and therefore the people's choice. The likelihood is that the people of the United Kingdom would call for reform and to get rid of the monarchy but this would cause countless problems: The monarchy generates massive revenue for the economy (through tourism etc.) and royal celebrations quite often bring in mass tourism and people of the realms (especially the British) spend money for souvenirs etc. It would also cause a massive problem and would cost billions to dispose of the monarchy. Thousands of jobs would be lost, many organisations such as the Royal Mint, Royal Mail etc. would require name, structural and governance changes. The military governance &amp; naming would change which would require renaming of almost all naval vessels and aircraft. C City status balloting would need to be revised and the house of lords would fall into disarray as all awards and titles such as MBEs, OBEs, Knighthoods, baronships, earlships etc. are awarded by the Crown. You also need to bear in mind that she is head of state for the Commonwealth realms also, not just the UK. So essentially the UK would be leaving the Commonwealth realms to dispose of her. This would create massive problems for other countries. New systems would need to be established with regards to the appointing of governments, the final signing of bills. This would mean the many problems created by the dissolution of the Crown could not be rectified. The amount of problems caused and the amount of money that would need spending to fix it would be too significant to even contemplate. To return to the original point, I doubt the monarchy would ever use a veto as this would cause dissolution of the monarchy which would end very very badly."
204,How do anarchist decision models scale?,NEGATIVE,"I have personally experienced anarchist decision models in groups of people up to several hundred people. Building consensus around a particular decision in smaller \"affinity groups\", sending representatives to the larger group, trying to reach consensus there, returning to the affinity groups, and iterating this process until consensus is reached among the entire group. I was very impressed how well it works. Freetown Christiania has a population of less than 1000 people, so the aforementioned model may still hold. But how do anarchist decision models work for entities with tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands or even millions of people? Perhaps the most notable historical example is the Spanish Revolution. I can see how decision-taking would work on a factory level, but how does can an anarchist society take decisions on large scale projects, such as infrastructure?"
205,"",NEGATIVE,"Not exactly, Democracies such as the United States and Russia are doing better financially than some Authoritarian countries such as North Korea. However some Authoritarian countries such as Libya (Now a Democracy?) and Saudi Arabia have profited well due to natural resources. Since most Non-Democratic Republic countries are in the Middle East/ Africa, they have profited well from oil so we can't really rely on that. If you consider that Authoritarian leaders can spend all the money they want to, It might make an Authoritarian government less economically secure. Also considering that leadership can't be changed even if they are destroying the country. Mainly though, economic growth depends on location and allies. Also, if an Authoritarian government is unstable and are at war with another country, or rebels due to their leadership, they might be spending the majority or their money on their army. In a democracy the budget is regulated by a congress, or parliament so that the right choices can be made. Since my answer to this question is no, I don't know if you want any resources, but just comment and I'll add a link. Edit Okay, for the most part this supports what I said about Saudi Arabia. I know Saudi Arabia isn't the only authoritarian government, but if there was any correlation, Saudi Arabia would most likely break it. Syria, for example is pretty low on the list. Democracies/Republics land high and low on this list so there is obviously no correlation there. Theocracies seem pretty low. As for constitutional monarchies the U.K is number 24, but Bahrain is 96. Here's a thread on another site that discusses this too."

I'm finding it difficult to find any information on the internet about the right of initiative in various countries. I know that the parliament always has it, and I know that in Poland the president or a large enough number of citizens do."
209,What amendment to the U.S. Constitution removed the provision for slaves to count as three fifths of a person?,NEGATIVE,"One of the compromises in the original U.S. Constitution provided that slaves counted as three fifths of a person for the purposes of computing populations and thus allocating seats to the House of Representatives. Where exactly does this provision fall in the Constitution and what amendment to the Constitution eliminates this or does it remain but no longer apply since there are no more slaves? How was the number 3/5ths arrived at, did it somehow provide population parity between the free and slave states?"

214,"",NEGATIVE,"Regarding the title question: By using some kind of proportional representation and an electoral threshold for it, but neither is strictly necessary. The German Basic Law, for example, stipulates that federal elections determine the composition of the parliament (Bundestag), which elects from among its members the head of the government, called federal chancellor (Bundeskanzler). Also, each session of the Bundestag has to convene first 30 days after the federal election, and the Bundeskanzler's term ends when a new Bundestag convenes. There are provisions as to what happens should the Bundestag fail to elect a Bundeskanzler on the first attempt, but none of them were ever relevant even although only one federal election resulted in one party having an absolute majority. In other words, the German government in all of the 17 sessions of the Bundestag so far consisted of a coalition of several parties (in 1957, the majority party kept one coalition partner from the previous session), but government formation always took less than 30 days. I think that qualifies as a functioning multi-party system, although one must note that there were always the same two major parties and a few smaller ones (sometimes only one, aligned with either of the larger ones at different times), and that four times Bundestag decided to dissolve early (after about 3 years instead of 4). As for the \"impact [...] this had on the government and it's people\", well, the government is still reasonably stable and uses to stick sometimes more, rarely less close to the \"coalition contact\" agreed to in the days/weeks after the election (only twice did the ruling coalition change during a term of the Bundestag, and in one of these cases this lead to one of the aforementioned earlier elections). As for the people, to them it probably just seems to be the normal way to go about these things, and others seem at least mildly irritating, like the Belgian way of keeping the previous government around until the new parliament has maybe, somehow, sometimes month later agrees to form a new one (as mentionned in gerrit's more comprehensive answer), or the American way of marginalizing anyone with a position corresponding to the German liberal, green or left parts, or the Israeli way of everyone mildly disagreeing with his party on a few issues breaking away and forming his own party that also gains representation (not statements of fact, but perceptions of other systems not unlikely when one is used to the German one)."

[...] Details shall be regulated by federal laws. ...and they are, so much that there is the word 'Parteiendemokratie' to describe the German political system. In contrast, political parties in the U.S. were established well after the constitution, and seem to have a different role. This German-language blog 'USA explained' even goes so far to claim 'There are no political parties [in the US]. It just seems that way. It's an illusion' (which, itself, is a movie allusion). Yet, as mentioned here, political parties in some U.S. states do not have to organize the election of their own candidates for a general election but have that done by state election officials, for example. So what is the legal role for political parties and where is it defined?"
217,"",NEGATIVE,"There's only one international set of criteria - the recognition by other countries. No political power is interested in creating an objective set of criteria - the power of recognition of a country is too meaningful for their national interests. However, the theoreticals can state the criteria for the country. It is the internal and external sovereignty - the ability to decide about themselves without acceptance from other country. Because sovereignty is a bit tricky - no country is fully sovereign in that sense, that it could do practically anything - but there's a meaningful criterion of sovereignty - a sovereign country can limit its sovereignty itself. So the sovereign country can become part of the treaty limiting its internal or/and external decisions, such as military pacts, trade treaties etc. - if any part of existing party would make such decision without the approval of the government of that country, this would cause immediate reaction (in worst case up to civil war). If the government is not able to oppose to such actions, we can speak that the province is practically sovereign."

You can find people from every corner of the political spectrum involved in Anonymous, I personally know of some from the far-left as well ass from the christian democratic center to right-wing extremists. So describing them as anything is impossible. It is only a label you use if you do not want to create a new organisation for a protest. Calling it a political movement is surely too far fetched."
219,"",NEGATIVE,"The only role for parties in the US is in minor regulations that the parties draw up. Some commissions, for example, state that parties may nominate a certain number of chairman. When the Constitution was written, George Washington (and other Federalists) had a high degree of hatred for \"faction,\" what we call parties today. They were more of a pragmatic evil then a thing to be supported. Due to this hatred, there was little reason the FF would actually enshrine their role in the Constitution in any way."
220,Why three levels of territorial units in the NUTS?,NEGATIVE,"The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics is an EU standard which defines three levels of territorial units. Whether directly because of this or because of related regulations, Poland underwent an administrative reform a couple of years before the EU accession. Before the reform, Poland had a two-level division, which was changed to a three-level one. Why is it considered better that the countries of the EU (at least the larger ones) be divided this way?"
221,What countries have (at some point in history) been able to significantly reduce their country's debt and what policies are generally attributed?,NEGATIVE,"As we here in the US (and many others in other countries) worry about our mounting debt, I wonder if there are any historical examples of countries (including the US) which have been able to significantly reduce their debt (real debt, not as percent of GDP)? Furthermore, what policies (if any) are generally accepted as having made important contributions to this reduction in debt?"
222,Are there any negative consequences for a country having no debt?,NEGATIVE,"It would seem that having no debt would categorically be a good thing. I have heard Dave Ramsey say many times that: The Forbes 400 is a list of the richest 400 people in America as rated by Forbes magazine. When surveyed, 75% of the Forbes 400 (rich people, not your broke brother-in-law with an opinion) said the best way to build wealth is to become and stay debt-free. Now, obviously he is talking about individuals and families. It made me wonder though if it applied to countries. Are there any (theoretical or historical) negative consequences of a country being (more or less) debt free?"

They are said to be all sick, elderly or close to the end of their sentence. But it seems strange anyway. The idea of the head of state pardoning prisoners seems strange in a modern political system. Why should a single person be given the right to make such arbitrary decisions? And it's not just the King of Thailand. The presidents of my country, Poland, also pardon prisoners on a regular basis. Not in such huge numbers, but they do."
224,"",NEGATIVE,"It's not a political movement as it does not have a coherent ideology or goals. It is a mask that can be worn by anybody who wants to gain support of other people to perpetrate certain actions, usually online.There are some factors though that unite those that perform actions under the banner of Anonymous - namely, they consider themselves to be opposed to wrongs perpetrated by people in power, they usually act by disrupting some part of internet infrastructure or publishing some private data that are related to the targets of the attacks. Anonymous is a brand or an idea rather than a movement. This specific idea is not about the goal but about the mode of action - so I do not think one can find any specific aims there. While actions perpetrated by Anonymous often conflict with various laws, it is not because they are political and ideological anarchists or want to destroy governments in principle and create stateless society, but rather because they perceive specific governments and organisations acting contrary to their (i.e. specific group of individuals perpetrating specific action) wishes and want to punish them for that."
225,"",NEGATIVE,"One of the provisions that the US made under the Articles of Confederation was the Land Ordinance of 1785. The Land Ordinance declared a system for selling lands in the Northwest Territory (Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota east of the Mississippi). The Land Ordinance was partially successful, and the minimum purchasing limits were later lowered to give more people a chance to purchase land. As a result, the United States slowly dug itself out of debt to about $33,000 or so in debt in 1835, the lowest debt ever in the United States (see here)."
226,"",NEGATIVE,"I think it is safe to say that when talking about the debt of a sovereign nation that we can agree that it is quite different than say personal or business debt at very fundamental levels. With that being said there are a number of policies that can be enacted to reduce a number of debts. The first two are obvious. Raise Taxes: The most obvious way to pay off debts is to increase revenue and this can be done by raising or levying new taxes or tariffs. Increasing additional revenue to apply to the debt for it to be paid down will decrease the overall number. The political advantages of this are that you can reduce debt without making difficult political decisions about which budgets and funds to slash. The cons are that nobody likes having their taxes raised and can be politically unpopular. Cut budgets: Governments usually form a budget that allocates a fixed amount to various programs or services for the year. More money will be left over if those budgets are slashed and can be applied to debts. Pros are that you help lower debts without raising anybodies taxes. Cons are that you are negatively hurting programs and services and that can be politically unpopular. Print More Money: Money is typically issued by governments, and despite the fact that it doesn't necessarily need to be backed by anything to have value, people still seek to accumulate it. To understand why people want money, and why people accept a governments money as currency is quite simple. The government simply has to state that all taxes due to the government must be paid using this currency. The fact that people must have the government money to pay their required taxes makes it universally valuable and accepted by the nations economy. Now the government simply has to print money and use it to fund its various spending for it to be circulated through the economy. The pros of this is that the government can spur economic activity in the short term simply by printing money for its spending and debt reductions. This spent money encourages companies to form, puts people to work who otherwise might not be working and can sometimes be the necessary adrenaline shot the economy needs. A good example are the quantitative easing programs currently run by the Fed right now. The cons of this however is that this can be harmful to the economy as a whole in the longer term as every printed dollar requires the economy to continue growing relative to the rate of printing money, otherwise inflation occurs. In a stagnant economy, inflation can run rampant as the value of the currency drops, each dollar applied to reductions of debt comes at the collective cost of every member of the economy. A good example of this is the Weimar Republic of Germany, that was under such crushing foreign debt after the first World War that it began to print money out of control to pay off this debt. Their currency became worthless and the economy had the wealth sucked out of it so to speak. Float Bonds: This is essentially a way to borrow money from one source to pay off liabilities or debts elsewhere. It is also the primary way that the United States issues new currency through the Federal Reserve. They do not simply print money directly but instead sell bonds to the Federal Reserve in exchange for the currency it needs to pay off other debts. Start a war/Nationalize foreign assets: One convenient way to handle absolving all the debt that you owe a particular nation is to start a war with them. One of the first things that happen in war time are the foreign assets of that country are nationalized and all foreign debts are forfeited. The pros are that you can simply give the middle finger to your debtor and bomb them. The con is obviously war. Notable examples are the rise of the Nazi party in Germany and how they essentially started a giant war to escape the old foreign debts from the other European countries, we see how well that turned out for them though. Another notable example would be the ancient Rome. They would accumulate debts with other nations to fund their military, then use that same military to conquer that nation and absolve their debts, and then in turn make their people tax paying Roman citizens."
227,"",NEGATIVE,"Alexander Hamilton believed (and convinced George Washington) that a little national debt (not the massive amount we have now) is a good thing. By being in a little debt, the countries that we owe money to would defend us in war because they don't want to lose their investment. Also, as long as we pay back the debt, with interest, other countries are more willing to be friendly with us because we are a good economic investment. If we were to have no debt, other countries would have no vested interest in us, and we would not have the same influence we did on other countries."
229,"",NEGATIVE,"Historically, such pardons were meant to generate goodwill of the governed, and popularize the ruler. There were two kinds of them: General pardons. They are simply a good-will gesture and to project a benevolent image. Political pardons. These were frequently tied to a recently-completed power/political struggle which caused a lot of opponents of the regime to be incarcerated; a wise ruler can use a pardon for low-level opposition supporters to help heal the divisions in society and again generate good will towards his regime from former opponents. An example of this would be Andrew Johnson's pardons of many former Confederate officials and military personnel after the American Civil War; or George Washington's pardons for Whiskey Rebellion members In US politics, but I would strongly suspect it was yet another exercise in checks and balances - a way to reverse the most egregious abuses of the law/judicial system, but on a small enough scale that the Executive could not abuse it. The origin of the power (Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution states that the President \"shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\") seems to be clearly explained in Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Paper #74: He is also to be authorized to grant \"reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT.\" Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate, that the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed. The criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity, that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel. As the sense of responsibility is always strongest, in proportion as it is undivided, it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready to attend to the force of those motives which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law, and least apt to yield to considerations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of its vengeance. The reflection that the fate of a fellow-creature depended on his sole fiat, would naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution; the dread of being accused of weakness or connivance, would beget equal circumspection, though of a different kind.."
230,"",NEGATIVE,"If we are talking about the United States and most countries that operate on a Fractional Reserve Banking system then a government unable to accumulate debt would be an economic disaster. Much like how a bank is able to lend out far more money than it holds in assets able to carry that risk, if everybody takes a run on the bank then the illusion of all that borrowed money in the system is crashed and the economy takes a nose dive. We maintain the illusion of course because of the simple fact that borrowing money now and quickly provides for a fast efficient economy. Governments are much the same way in that they are also borrowing from central banks by floating bonds. These bonds have an opportunity to mature so that they cannot be paid back immediately. They retain value however as long as people are willing to buy them, and they are valuable even though they may never be really paid back because the government spends a good deal of its annual budget on servicing that debt (paying interest). That interest is generally good to peg to inflation which is why they are considered safe as long as the government as considered safe and legitimate. So in essence most money introduced the system is through debt, and while it is a house of cards, the alternative would be that government would be slow and ineffective to react, unable to handle national emergencies or wars, and would periodically run the risk of ineffective services due to an extremely volatile income (tax income goes down in a bad economy). If instead they were to print money every time they ran short then inflation would be highly volatile as well and this would cause the economy to be highly volatile (Eg. see the 19th century US economy for an example). For matters of national security, and a quick efficient economy the government must be able to introduce money into the system by taking on debt as it does not have a sudden effect on inflation and makes the government more functional."
231,Are there any states that require leaders to respect empirical studies?,NEGATIVE,"It's possible to divide policy positions into two broad categories: X is good/bad - for example: Smoking is bad Home-ownership is good Bovine tuberculosis is bad X will encourage/discourage Y - for example: Higher taxes on cigarettes will discourage smoking Low interest rates will encourage home-ownership Systematic culling of badgers will reduce bovine tuberculosis I'm interested here in the second of these. Policies along the lines of \"X will encourage Y\" can in many cases be empirically tested; for example, by randomly selecting geographical areas in which to implement badger culls, and rigorously studying their effectiveness. The impression I get is that politicians are resistant to such methodical studies, and implement them only as a response to opposition to policies they wish to implement, subsequently ignoring the results if they aren't \"right\". Are there any states, regions, etc. where those in power are or have been bound (either by statute or manifesto commitment) to subject policy to empirical study? And if so, are there instances where a policy found to be ineffective has been abandoned?"

For example: Some USA states are supposed to set certain speed limits based on \"Engineering and Traffic Surveys\" which measure, among other things, the \"Prevailing speeds\" along a given stretch of road. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is supposed to use a variety of studies (principally clinical trials) to formulate its regulations. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is supposed to use Environmental Impact Reports to make its decisions. There are, no doubt, many more examples throughout the World, but I can't find (so far) any requirement that can't be trumped by legislatures. Legislatures can always change the laws to ignore, exempt or abolish empirical requirements but, at least in the USA, they only seem to do so occasionally. I've not heard of a constitution-level document, or practice, that requires empirical studies."
236,Is there any objective reason why some states can have nuclear weapons but others can't?,NEGATIVE,"Many countries around the world suspect that Iran is attempting to build a nuclear weapon. Regardless of whether this is true or not, is there any objective reason why the US, UK, France, and others are \"allowed\" to have nuclear weapons, and others cannot, or is the only reason because they are either western allies or too powerful for the US to subjugate? E.g., would neutral countries have any reason to support the possession of nuclear weapons by the US, but object to nuclear weapons by Iran?"
237,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"The reason why some countries can have nuclear weapons is easy to find in this article: Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, where you can read very interesting topics. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT, is a landmark international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament. First pillar: non-proliferation Five states are recognized by the Non-Proliferation Treaty as nuclear weapon states (NWS): China (signed 1992), France (1992), the Soviet Union (1968; obligations and rights now assumed by the Russian Federation), the United Kingdom (1968), and the United States (1968) (The United States, UK, and the Soviet Union were the only states openly possessing such weapons among the original ratifiers of the treaty, which entered into force in 1970). These five nations are also the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Non parties to the treaty Four non-parties to the treaty are known or believed to possess nuclear weapons: India, Pakistan and North Korea have openly tested and declared that they possess nuclear weapons, while Israel has had a policy of opacity regarding its own nuclear weapons program. North Korea acceded to the treaty in 1985, but never came into compliance, and announced its withdrawal in 2003. So as you can see in the previous quote there are exceptions to the rule like US, France, China and Russia, and there are countries which haven't approved the treaty like North Korea and India, but the countries that approved the treaty must fallow its pillars. In fact there is no reason, in theory all the countries have the same rights, and so if United States, Israel, India and others have nuclear weapons then any other country should be allowed to have. By my point of view if a country doesn't want that other country have nuclear weapons or biological weapons that country must show the example and do what it request and disable all its weapons of this kind, because the rule should be followed by everyone and not only for some unprivileged, because they are equals in rights."
238,If all the citizens have same rights why some must pay a higher tax rate?,NEGATIVE,"If all the citizens of a country have the same rights and are equal before the law, why some must pay more taxes? Isn't that a kind of discrimination?"
239,"",NEUTRAL,"Governments, whether they be monarchies, dictatorships, democracies or communist have a common goal in promoting the safety, well being and overall good of the people. Often this means that certain groups will be targeted for taxes or benefits to promote the general common good. Many people believe that a strong social safety net reduces economic volatility and provides for a better quality of life overall in a modern capitalist country for nearly all involved. The security of knowing that when faced with hard times that you will not starve or become homeless due to a few bad breaks in life is often reason enough to support public unemployment compensation, social security, welfare, food stamps, and even public healthcare. These are extraordinarily expensive however so taxes must be raised to pay for these things. Furthermore it can be argued that a strong social safety net has a positive effect on economic growth, as the consequences of a failed business venture are not quite as extreme when you know that your family will not starve if you take out a large loan for an unsuccessful business or startup. These kinds of policies promote economic growth and support small businesses ultimately. On the point of fairness, there are a number of taxes that are inherently unfair yet are politically very popular and easy to implement. \"Sin\" taxes like the exorbitant taxes on cigarettes and alcohol are a prime example of ones that target a specific group because it is politically easy to target them. Nobody wants to look soft on tobacco or seem like they are promoting alcohol, so few oppose such taxes and the majority of people support it because these are inherently sales taxes and are mostly transparent to the uneducated consumer. With that being said no we address the fairness, that if all people are equal before the law and all have the same rights as citizens, we are certainly not and never will be all equal as individuals. I may have been born with innate advantages in life, born into wealth or perhaps I am Bill Gates (who consequently was in the very least upper middle class as a child) and made a few lucky breaks and was in the right place in the right period of time. The fairness argument above can also be said that the opportunities available in this country, and the rights that our government and military have protected for us make it fair for the government to ask for a little bit more from people who would not be terribly pained by this. Asking a little bit more from somebody who is living paycheck to paycheck is an enormous burden on that person. So in the benefit of the common good we can make a number of arguments to justify if higher taxes on one group of people is fair. Certainly not in all cases, but the argument can be made that it can sometimes be fair. But then taxes are not just a means to gain income for the government, they also happen to be a convenient way to encourage behavior in citizens that benefit the economy and strengthen its people overall. Lower capital gains vs. income tax/estate tax: Having a higher income tax or estate tax rate as compared to capital gains income encourages the wealthy to not only invest their money but to keep it invested rather than sit on it. More investment helps the economy grow. Sin Taxes: Discourages behaviors that affect public health and cause higher healthcare spending overall as a percentage of GDP. Mortgate Interest Deduction: Encourages home ownership in the middle class. Housing starts are the primary indicator of a health US economy, and so goes the world. So taxes (or high taxes with loopholes) may seem unfair, but if one believes that the ends justify the means then the benefits of influencing good economic behavior and promoting overall economic growth justify that decision."
240,"",NEGATIVE,"Literally speaking, yes, it is a kind of discrimination, although not in the usual sense of the word. It discriminates between citizens based on their income or property, but not usually based on personal characteristics such as sex or age¹. As to the \"why\" question, I'd like to add one point to @maple_shaft's extensive answer. A progressive tax rate may be used as an instrument to level out differences in wealth. The highest income brackets have a higher tax rate. This reduces the difference between poor and rich, which has many advantages, for example: It benefits economic growth more if someone living on the minimum wage gets X $/month extra than if someone already rich gets X $/month extra, because the poor person is likely to spend every single extra $ they get, whereas the rich person may just put it on a savings account or invest it in Chinese factories. A reduction in income differences may increase social stability and reduce crime. Of course, there are also disadvantages. Perceived fairness may be one of them, as is the consequence that working more would not add as much extra money in ones pocket as it would otherwise. But I think most (but not all) legislations have some form of a progressive tax rate. ¹Some policies may have the apparent effect of discriminating based on age; for example, in some legislations, income from labour may be taxed at a lower rate than income from pensions, but it's not age per se that is the factor of discrimination."

There's no real reason why a Sheriff would need to be appointed to be more effective in his or her office (in most places), so it remains an elected office allowing for the people to determine if a changing of the guard might be in order.

Independence was rejected by a narrow margin, with 50.58% voting against. Quoting from the Wikipedia article: The day after the referendum, Jacques Parizeau resigned as the leader of the Parti Québécois, as he had said he would do in an interview with TVA taped days before the referendum but not made public until after the vote. Lucien Bouchard was the only candidate to succeed him. Bouchard became Premier on January 29, 1996. Over the course of the next few years, support for sovereignty decreased. Despite winning reelection in 1998, the PQ chose not to hold another referendum, waiting for \"winning conditions\". The PQ would lose the 2003 provincial election to the Liberal Party of Quebec, led by Jean Charest. In the decade after the failed referendum, Parti Québécois dropped from 45% to 28% of the vote. Whether this is a consequence of the failed referendum, I don't know, but I guess it might be, and I wouldn't be surprised if a failed independence referendum in Scotland (or, for that matter, Catalonia) would have similar consequences. Edit, 3½ years later: In the Scottish independence referendum, 2014, 55.30% of the voters rejected Scottish independence. In only four local authorities (including Dundee and Glasgow) did a majority support independence. In the United Kingdom parliamentary election, 2015, the SNP saw its share of the Scottish vote increase from 20% to 50%, leading to an increase from 6 to 56 seats (out of 59 Scottish seats) in the first-past-the-post system. In the Scottish Parliament election, 2016, SNP saw its constituency vote increase slightly (from 45.4% to 46.5%) and its regional vote decrease slightly (from 44.0% to 41.7%), leading to a decrease from 69 to 63 seats (out of 129) in the additional member system. Membership increased from 25,642 in September 2014 to 116,000 in April 2016. Of course, other things have happened in the meantime and it is difficult to attribute trends to any single event. However, it is apparent that the lost independence referendum did not lead to a decrease in SNP popularity (thus far)."
247,"",NEGATIVE,"There is really no \"good\" answer. The countries only have as much rights as they have the actual practical power to enforce given objective worldwide geopolitical realities. Remember that even UN resolutions don't have any practical power outside UN member states sending military forces to enforce them, or implement economic sanctions effectively. This is the only[1] objective reason. Nobody has the power to stop US/USSR/China/UK/France from having nukes, whether they would like to or not. OTOH, the Big Countries on the block sometimes have the power to stop other countries from having nukes - and note that they are not usually successful because they don't have THAT much power (witness Iran - despite all the posturing, the effective rate of success of everyone else in stopping - or even slowing down - their nuclear program is slightly below that of stopping Russians from drinking alcohol during their Prohibition in 1980s). Pretty much the ONLY examples of countries that were seriously determined to get nukes but were stopped successfully due to non-related circumstances were Syria and Iraq (South Africa and Lybia don't count as they abandoned their programs for unrelated reasons). [1] - Not quite - there is also domestic political pressure. A country may refrain from developing or having nuclear weapons because its domestic political considerations oppose the idea for whatever reasons - e.g., Japan opposes it because of the memory of 1945, Ukraine opposed it because they were enticed by material support offers from the West post-USSR-breakup (which I suppose they greatly regretted by now). There are powerful anti-nuclear movements in many western countries. A second objective reason is that once one country has a lot of nukes, it may be in the interests of stability for other countries without means to match them to have a counter-balancing global power to have nukes. Mutual assured destruction may seem counter-intuitive, but it DID work."
248,Do referendums lead to significantly different decisions than when decisions are taken by parliament?,VERY_NEGATIVE,"One argument that is used against decision-making by popular referendum is that they tend to lead to populist, perhaps even impossible decisions. It seems that referendums can lead to decisions that corresponding legislations would not take. The Swiss minaret ban from 2009 is a(n) (in)famous example. In a Swiss referendum in 1989, more than 35% voted in favour of abolishing the army; although not near a majority, it was accepted in two cantons, and in parliament this idea would not have gotten such a high percentage. Has there been any systematic study to test whether referendums lead to significantly different decisions than when all decisions are taken by elected parliamentarians? The term populist is probably quite subjective, but would such decisions be likely to be considered populist?"
249,Why is the president unable to grant a pardon for State offenses?,NEGATIVE,"In the US, as in many modern countries, we have a presidential pardon. However, we also have many state government pardons. The constitution states and he shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States However, according to the US DoJ, he cannot pardon a state offense. However, the President cannot pardon a state criminal offense. This doesn't seem clear to me. Wouldn't any offense against any state be an offense against the United States? Isn't that the whole point of being united? I can't seem to find any supreme court ruling on the matter."
250,"",NEGATIVE,"I've found Franklin, M. N., Van der Eijk, C., &amp; Marsh, M. (1995). Referendum outcomes and trust in government: Public support for Europe in the wake of Maastricht to show some significant insights on the outcome of referenda and what they represent. A key phrase from the abstract is the following: In this paper we dispute this assumption, presenting evidence that shows referenda in Parliamentary systems with disciplined party governments to be subject to what we call a ‘lockstep’ phenomenon in which referendum outcomes become tied to the popularity of the government in power, even if the ostensible subject of the referendum has little to do with the reasons for government popularity (or lack of popularity). Based on this outcome, one could question the viability of referenda as a serious tool to aid decision-making. I think it would be quite difficult to compare the results of a referendum to decisions made solely by parliament, at least when using a scientific approach. The fact that a referendum is conducted and parliament is informed of the outcome casts a bias over the decision-making process, making scientific comparision inheritly difficult."
251,Does the head-of-state pardon violate separation of powers?,NEGATIVE,"In a rechtsstaat, separation of powers in legislative, executive, and judicial powers provides some protection to the civilians and reduces the power of government. In some legislations, however, the head of state has the power to grant a pardon, meaning the forgiveness of a crime and the cancellation of the relevant penalty. Does this violate the separation of powers? Similar, but slightly different question: What is the head-of-state pardon for?"
252,"",NEGATIVE,"It is impossible to answer as stated, because the answer to \"does X amount to equal/unequal rights\" depends on the precise wording of what the right is. Therefore, people who favor higher taxes on the \"rich\", claim that the right is to have a minimal amount of money (in which case, taxing those with more than that amount violates no rights; and moreover, NOT taxing to give to those who don't have it would violate their rights). Whereas those who oppose such an approach would claim that the right is to not have the money YOU earned taken from you by threat of force without our consent (or to not have more taken - percentage or amount wise - than from everyone else). Both answers are correct/incorrect entirely on how you word the \"rights\". The practical problem in the USA is that Constitution, as written, has very vague legal rights listed in it (\"pursuit of Happiness\" from Declaration of Independence). Everything else is up for interpretation by nine dudes and dudettes on the Supreme Court. So if the Nine decide that Constitution doesn't afford one the right to NOT have a hefty chunk of what you worked hard to earn taken from you, you don't have that right. If they decide that you have a right to a free college tuition as part of \"pursuit of Happiness\", you have that right. Things get even more murky and subjective when you start dealing with \"rights\" as moral/ethical as opposed to legal constructs."
253,"",NEGATIVE,"As the linked question's cite of Federalist Paper #74 shows, the whole point of the pardon is to violate the separation of powers, to enable an additional check-and-balance. So the answer to your question is \"yes\". It does violate separation of powers. Separation of powers, like any other theoretical idea, is not absolute and has exceptions, blurry lines and other facets. Executive branch can legislate via regulations; legislature can administrate by conducting foreign policy (See Nancy Pelosy's visit to Syria as a very random example that first sprang to mind); Judges effectively legislate from the bench (I can easily find examples to satisfy both ends of political spectrum)."
254,"",NEGATIVE,"The aim of the separation of powers is to prevent the situation wherein one person would have too much power over the others. So, he/she would have the right to make a law, execute it, and judge according to it. Since the right of Pardon doesn't give the head of state the ability to condemn anyone, only to release someone who has been condemned, it is not a violation of the principle -- it does not give the head of state the possibility of condemning his/her opponents, for example. The idea behind the right of Pardon is rather the correction of some judicial mistakes, when the letter of the law was against its spirit. I think it can be less the case in countries with Anglo-Saxon law systems, where the judges have more freedom with interpretation of the law."
255,"",NEGATIVE,"As opposite to the assumption from the question, if all citizens have the same rights, why can't some of them use something, what other can? Why can't an unemployed use a limousine, a yacht or a house with swimming pool? Isn't this the discrimination? The equal rights mean that two citizens in identical situation will be treated the same. So, two citizens will pay the same taxes if they have the same material status etc. From philosophical point of view the reason why some people must pay more taxes than the others can be answered with my inversion of your thesis: they must pay more taxes because they can use more goods."
256,What is the difference between fascism and nazism?,NEGATIVE,"Many politicians and social groups use \"fascism\" and \"nazism\" synonymously, and this has confused me (and maybe others) for a long time. Is there any big difference between them, or are the differences so minimal that it's ok to use them as synonyms?"
257,"",NEGATIVE,"Fascism is a less broad ideology, and Nazism is more or less a superset of it (in other words, someone following Nazism as an ideology would likely subscribe to all the ideas of fascism, and a few extra ones that other non-Nazi fascists may not. As a typical example, racial superiority ideas were part of Nazism, but not strictly speaking a major foundational part of fascism. Please also note that scholars frequently distinguish fascism (a generic ideology) and capital-F fascism which was a specific variant of it as practiced by Mussolini's regime in Italy."
258,"",NEGATIVE,"In the U.S. is bound by constitutional law to only allow the President to issue federal pardons, per Article II, Section 2, para 1: The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment. The key words here are Offences against the United States, which is only the Federal level. It is prevented from going further because the 10th amendment states: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
259,"",NEGATIVE,"Fascism is the regime/ideology of anti-democracy. The state is absolute and totalitarian and all citizens must follow the state. Whether this applies just to a regime or also to an ideology advocating this form of regime, may be debatable. National-Socialism or Nazism is a racist and antisemitic ideology which holds that the Aryan race is superior to all other races, and that the government must actively promote the perfect race. Nazism tends to be fascist, but fascism is not necessarily national-socialist. Edit: Some comments mention communism. In theory, communism is supposed to be democratic in the long run (the dictatorship of the proletariat is supposed to be just a phase), and many nominally socialist or communist countries pretended to be so (for example, the German Democratic Republic). The fact that in practice it became totalitarian and at times hard to distinguish from fascism (such as under Stalin) is an illustration of its failure. Fascism, on the other hand, is anti-democratic by design."
260,What methodologies of measuring the power of the state are researched today?,NEGATIVE,"What methodologies are used today to measure the power of the state in an objective way? Most of the classifications are based on either intuition (publicist one) or take into account only one or few factors. I've come in contact with power measurement studies in Poland, where the term 'Potęgonomia' exists, but I've failed when I've tried to find the English term for those studies. There exists the study of prof. Sułek, who has proposed a mathematical equation for measuring the power of the state, but this is the only study I know of."
262,"",NEGATIVE,"Another interpretation of left and right that one may come across relates to the distribution of power. In a simplified way, the right is associated with a top-down power structure, whereas the left is associated with an egalitarian distribution of power. This distribution fits with what most people would associate with left and right in daily life. Right-wing ideologies favour power structures that are top-down. This can be power by the church, the state, corporations, etc. The most extreme example of this are extreme-right ideologies such as fascism, which is the ideology of anti-democracy. Depending on interpretation of power, also models that allow for very large corporate freedom (such as anarcho-capitalism/libertarianism) are far right, because corporations are not normally democratically controlled. See also wage slavery. The left, then, favours egalitarian power models. As society originates in top-down power models, such ideologies are often radical or revolutionary in nature. In its extreme, this can be expressed by the utopian German (double negative) slogan Keine Macht für Niemand, which literally means no power for nobody. The ideal expressed by this phrase is that nobody holds power over anybody else. This is not limited to politics, but also to other aspects of life, most notably at work. In such a distribution of power, work is not associated with shareholder-owned corporations, but with worker-owned cooperatives. The division above is consistent with the traditional distribution of ideologies in left and right. Left-wing is big government and right-wing is small government, because in our society the government is more or less the only institution under some democratic control, so if power is transferred from a democratically controlled government to uncontrolled corporations, power becomes more top-down; if power resides with a democratically controlled government, power becomes more egalitarian. Of course, this breaks down if a government is not democratically controlled. In this model: Fascism is far-right because it explicitly strives for a authoritarian distribution of power. Anarcho-capitalism can be considered far-right because it takes away almost all power from democratically controlled organs, but whether this leads to a vertical distribution of power depends on where this power goes. If this power is taken by shareholder-owned corporations, it means power distribution becomes more vertical. Theocratic systems favour a strong power for religious institutes. I think those are mostly hierarchical in nature; I'm not aware of strongly democratic religions. That would put theocracies on the right (see also conservative below). Communism is far left in theory, because it puts workers in control of the factories and of the state. In practice it turned out quite authoritarian, so rather right-wing and in its extremes alarmingly close to its ideological opposite, fascism. However, even if the situation turned out similar in practice, the propaganda, what the nations claimed to be, was still vastly different between the worst era of Stalinism and fascist states. Socialism and Social-democracy tend to empower workers, but to a lesser degree than communism, and are therefore less far left on the scale. Anarcho-syndicalism is perhaps the most far left, approaching the utopia where nobody holds power over everybody else, by putting the means of production in hands of democratic councils, e.g. factories are owned by the workers etc. The power of the state is minimal, but contrary to anarcho-capitalism, this power is transferred to small-scale democratically owned organs, not to huge multinational shareholder-owned corporations. Conservative ideologies tend to the status quo. The status quo is usually a quite top-down division of power, so those can be considered right-wing. Progressive and revolutionary ideologies favour to change society. Most of those ideologies are on the left, such as communism and anarcho-syndicalism. However, nazism was also revolutionary in nature, although left-wing revolutionaries may choose to use the term reactionary, as nazism was also strongly anti-revolutionary in nature. Now this interpretation is not unique, but I think it works well to describe most important ideologies. Your mileage may vary :)"
263,"",NEGATIVE,"This is a very broad question. I am assuming you mean in recent history. I am also assuming you mean OECD or rich countries, since there are some resource rich countries that have little to no taxes. I am also assuming, since you point to that specific proposal, that you are ruling out VATs and only want to know about sales taxes. Having said that, the short answer is that I can't think of a single large economy that has only had a sales tax, and nothing else. Not even low tax countries such as Switzerland rely exclusively on sales taxes. In fact, countries that have tried high sales taxes have backed away from them because of tax evasion, some of them moving to use VATs: http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/improve/retail/abroad.cfm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax"

265,Has there ever been a successful application of Liquid Democracy in recent (non-ancient) history?,NEGATIVE,"While looking for the best application of a Democratic regime, people tend to look either at Athenian Democracy (as applied in Ancient Athens that is) or at Grassroots/Liquid Democracy (as supposedly promoted by (some?) Pirate Parties worldwide). Direct democracy applications are not viable for various reasons, mainly due to the vast amount of voters and disinterest by the citizens (that's why most prefer to just vote for their representantives). Grassroots/Liquid is an interesting hybrid between direct and representantive democracy. So, have there been any successful applications of the model, and if not then why?"
266,"",NEGATIVE,"I'm unaware of any FairTax systems being implemented in an actual real life situation, but there's a (length) article on the subject detailing about a simulation: Jokisch, S., &amp; Kotlikoff, L. J. (2005). Simulating the dynamic macroeconomic and microeconomic effects of the FairTax. The article is very positive about the potential implementation of a FairTax system. To be fair, the article was written in 2005 - well before the economic decline - but the simulations are done on a long term basis, so they should still be considered viable. According to our simulation model, these policy changes would almost double the U.S. capital stock by the end of the century and raise long-run real wages by 19 percent compared to the base case alternative. They would also preclude a doubling of the highly regressive payroll tax. Indeed, the poorest members of each cohort experience remarkably large welfare gains from the FairTax. To be specific, today's elderly poor are predicted to experience a 13 to 14 percent welfare gain. In contrast, their middle class counterparts enjoy a 1 to 2 percent gain, and their richest counterparts experience a .5 to 1 percent welfare loss. Poor baby boomers experience 8 percent gains, while middle- and upper-income boomers experience either very small welfare losses or small gains. And concluding.. Yes, some initial high- and middle-income households are made worse off, but their welfare losses are minor compared with the gains available to future generations, particularly the poorest members of future generations. The economic and welfare gains from switching to the FairTax are somewhat smaller if one models the U.S. economy as fully open to international capital flows. But these gains are nonetheless large and very significant. The general consensus of the article seems to be that while the current US tax system benefits the aging, it is damaging to the macro-economy on a broader scale. The base case simulation (as executed by Jokisch &amp; Kotlikoff) underlines this. The model predicts a major reduction in take-home-pay for average workers. FairTax is presented as a cure - not only does it increase general nett salary, it also has a levelling effect on the economy as a whole, benefiting the less well-off. While there is an ever so strong opposition to levelling policies in the US, on a global scale (e.g. in Western Europe) it's a more accepted approach."
267,"",NEGATIVE,"TL;DR: Tea Party is a political movement as opposed to a party. Tea Party is largely anti-Democratic-Party as far as both ideology and practice, and therefore is in an shifting form of a merger/alliance/intersection with Republicans for partly-tactical, partyly-pragmatuc, partly-ideological reasons. Expanded answer: Well, for starters, one is a formal political party, and one is a loosely (VERY loosely) organized movement that's not really a \"real\" party, despite the name. It's a \"movement\", not a party. Tea \"party\"'s main unifying political position is lower taxes (the name is frequently \"decyphered\" as Taxed Enough Already) and lower government spending. Please note what was missing from the above? That's right, any words about \"Republican\". If you look at the two main beefs of Tea Party, it's true that one of them was Obamacare. But the second most favorite thing they oppose was Bush-initiated TARP bank bailout, for which Tea Party blamed establishment Republicans as much as Democrats. However, in practice, Tea Party is largely anti-Democratic-Party as far as both ideology and practice, and therefore is in an shifting form of a merger/alliance/intersection with Republicans for partly-tactical, partly-pragmatic, partly-ideological reasons: A majority (whether overwhelming or not) of people typically active or supporting Tea Party are people who are more likely than not vote Republican in elections; or more specifically, vote against Democrats (this is a pretty important distinction - for example, in STV elections, many of them would instead likely vote Libertarian as a first choice, and Republican only as a second choice for tactical reason). This is quite understandable, as a typical Democrat supporter and/or politician may have one of many different political positions - just like Republicans do - but a vast majority of those views are incompatible with lower taxes, either for ideological reasons (they favor income redistribution as a goal), or practical ones (somehow their favorite programs gotta get financed). Just to validate that this is not an opinion but a reality - the latest 2012 poll had 84% of Democrats supporting higher taxes*. As such, when given a choice between a Democrat and a Republican in an election, a typical Tea Party voter would be extremely unlikely to pick the former. Republicans in USA don't really have a unified political position - they are an amalgamation of all sorts of interests, from lower-taxes-fiscal-conservatives, to social conservatives (some of whom care about taxes and some don't give a hoot), to defence hawks, to rightish libertarians of objectivist stripe to center libertarians of Paulist stripe, to simply people who want to get elected but can't as democrats (For example, Mike Bloomberg is formerly a Democrat and now nominally a Republican. If he ever taken any \"typically\" Republican views in his public life, he hid it very well). This means that, unlike Democratic \"84% for higher taxes\" tent, there appears to be a friendlier space in Republican tent for people who are aligned with Tea Party movement's main goal of less federal spending and lower taxes; even if Republican party as a whole has many strains that are NOT in alignment with Tea Party goals. To add to this, the answer is further complicated by two competing/interrelated dynamics: Having learned from electoral success (or rather, lack thereof) of Libertarians, Greens, and other 3rd party attemps that are hamstrung by first-past-the-post electoral system in USA, Tea Party movement sees Republican Party as a political implementation of achieving its goal, via getting its representatives elected on \"R\" ticket instead of the Republicans who are more aligned with establishment and thus contrary to Tea Party goals by acquiescing to higher taxes and looser fiscal policy pushed by Democrats. They have been partly successful in this, by having a slate of \"Tea Party\" affiliated Republican legislators elected (who coalesced into \"Tea Party\" caucus in the House), albeit with some infamous failures by running way-substandard candidates for Senate in 2008. Barring that, influencing non-Tea-Party Rs to their viewpoint the way any other interest constituency in Republican party does. Republican establishment sees Tea Party as a useful political power to harness to help them due to obvious synergies (basically, Rs are less of an enemy to tea party goals than Ds are due to taxation positions). To achieve this, they use 2-pronged approach: They \"infiltrated\" Tea Party by creating groups within the movement that share the monicker yet are funded and organized by Republican bigwigs (unlike original Tea Party, which was self-organized and largely ran on opposition to Bush's TARP bailouts); They (at times) successfully harnessed the motivation and energy of Tea Party supporters for R's electoral purposes in general, by positing an obvious point that a non-quite-Tea-Party-friendly R elected is still better than a D to the ideals of Tea Party."

271,"",NEGATIVE,"You could equally well ask If all the citizens have the same rights why are some allowed to earn more money than others? Sure it could be argued they earned it and therefore deserve it. But how do you determine if somebody deserves money? Money is just a social convention that says the people who possess it are entitled to change it for goods. By the original line of reasoning you could argue that everybody should pay the same amount of tax (say $ 10 000), would that be fair? If you argue not it is probably because you think that people who have more means can contribute a little more, the same argument can be used to argue in favor of progressive rates. I don't think there is a single correct answer to your question, but to search for it probably one should try to ask oneself what do we mean by the concept of \"having the same rights\"? One generally get rich mostly by luck, and partly because of personal characteristics. Does having a little more intuition about how the stock market works really entitle you to earn 1000 times more money than the average guy. Would it really be so unjust to only let him have say 200 times as much money? (yes that would mean enforcing a whopping 80% tax rate). It seems that the best way to decide tax rates would be by looking at the benefits for society on the whole as others have pointed out in their answers. Update: just to be clear, I'm not saying flat taxes are necessarily bad (although I personally think they probably are), I'm only saying that they cannot be justified only on the basis that \"everybody has the same rights\""
272,What alternatives have been proposed for prison sentences for violent crimes?,NEGATIVE,"According to prison critics and others, prisons are schools of crime. This viewpoint holds that when someone gets a prison sentence for a small crime, they will meet bigger criminals and build a social network among criminals. Secondly, the viewpoint asserts that when released from prison, regular elements of society do not wish to receive the person, whereas criminal networks do. These factors may then lead to recidivism. Now of course there are other points of view, but my question is: what alternative systems to prison sentences have been proposed? For small and juvenile crimes, one alternative that has been proposed is forced labour (cleaning parks, etc.), but have any alternatives been proposed for serious, violent crimes, such as rape, armed robbery, and murder?"
273,"",NEGATIVE,"There isn't an objective reason but the common sense makes think this: Case 1, Two levels of organization, imagine that you have a very large territory to be administrated by only 1 person (governors), if that is so then the \"distance\" between the citizens and that person is long, because he has several problems to solve and several major works to undertake, and usually these governors attend the source of the votes the capitol of the province, isolating the other cities, causing some people will feel that they are unattended by the government. The second bigger problem is that other parties won't be in executive government of the region and that causes sectarianism, rancor and despair with the party which is in control. Case 2, Three levels of organization, when a person has smaller territories to be administrate is easy to think that this person become more efficient in work, because that person is near to the problems, that makes that the citizens (and their problems) easier to attend by this person. The second point is that splitting a big region in smaller ones \"creates\" more political positions that helps to minority parties to take some of these positions, reducing the rancor and despair between parties."

275,"",NEGATIVE,"First of all you may not consider the NUTS scale as influencing political or administrative divisions directly. Because then you would need to consider also the LAU (Local administrative unit) which before represented the NUTS level 4 and 5. You can as an example look at Luxembourg where NUTS-1 through -3 is identical with the whole country and which consists only of LAUs. In larger countries the NUTS-levels together with the LAU-levels give policy makers the ability to gather statistics independently of territorial subdivisions. You do not need to have an administrative subdivision to apply a NUTS-level to a part of a larger division. In short NUTS and LAU are statistical tools that, while often coinciding with administrative boundaries, do not need to be equal with administrative subdivisions."

The definition of \"extreme far left\" or \"extreme far right\" tends to mean \"more wrong than other stupid people in the opposing party.\" Within the Republican Party, for example - typically the party of low taxes and low government involvement, there is a faction known as the \"Tea Party,\" which is even more strident in its opposition to taxes then the rest of the party. (And I say this as a pretty conservative Republican.) Remember also, that even Democrats view a 39% tax rate as \"high,\" something say a Swede or a Norwegian would laugh at. Paul Ryan, on the other hand, considered to be pretty hardcore, considers a tax rate of 25% to be appropriate for the highest tax rate. Again, not that far. As to the emergence of third parties - the mere fact that the U.S. has a \"First-past-the-post\" system tends to discourage them. To be sure, there is typically a \"Constitution Party\" that advocates low tax rates (like Ryan), and conservative social laws (like overturning Roe v. Wade) that might get 1% of the vote. And, there are the Libertarians who would have us all smoking pot whenever we wanted, and they too might get 1%. The Greens - in the U.S. strictly environmentalist, no Communism here! - are in the same league. There just isn't really an appetite. The most successful third party in recent memory - Ross Perot's 1992 Presidential bid - actually garnered around 19% of the popular vote. But, in Perot's case, he held very \"moderate\" views. He wanted to cut the budget, raise taxes, and restructure debt - but overall it was a \"take a business approach to the government.\" Overall, it was a very moderate, \"pox on both your houses\" approach to politics. And, even with such a strong showing, Perot was unable to make a serious long-term impact on politics, mostly because his best ideas were co-opted by the two established parties. The lesson to be taken is this - extreme views just don't make a difference in American Politics. They might get token votes, but only the hardest core political junkies know about them. Only in the tightest races (2000 - Ralph Nader) do they even get looked at. Those views that do impact the nation tend to get absorbed into the established parties, so they stay mainstream. In short, extremism don't really work well in the United States."
281,"",NEGATIVE,"A Progressive tax rate (meaning that the rich pay more) is typically predicated on a very specific definition of fairness that realizes: An equal percentage is still harder on the poor. Imagine, for example, that all people were taxed at 10%. The guy who makes $1000 a week would only have $900 left over at the end. That $100 is very, very precious. It can mean the difference between groceries or medicine. The guy who makes $10,000 a week would still have $9,000 left over. The margin increase in living standard that the $1,000 gives is far less significant than the $100 the poorer guy pays. At a certain point, one's standard of living is pretty well set. In the case above, it might mean the difference between a vacation in Maui or Tahiti, but it isn't going to determine the same hard economic choices above. That's the typical justification for increasing the rate as income goes up."

283,What is the difference between sortition and demarchy?,NEGATIVE,"What is the difference between demarchy and sortition? The Wikipedia article for demarchy: Demarchy (or lottocracy) is a form of government in which the state is governed by randomly selected decision makers who have been selected by sortition (lot) from a broadly inclusive pool of eligible citizens. The Wikipedia article for sortition: In politics, sortition (also known as allotment or the drawing of lots) is the selection of decision makers by lottery. Can demarchy work with any other selection system than sortition? And can sortition be used in any system that is not a demarchy? See also: What are the main advantages and disadvantages of sortition?"
284,"",NEGATIVE,"Sortition can be used for systems other than demarchy. More specifically, when you randomly select, but NOT from a \"broadly inclusive pool of eligible citizens\", but from a far smaller pool (often 2) pre-selected through other methods such as election. For example, several localities in USA have laws that, in case of an electoral tie, the winner is determined by a random choice (lots, or coin toss). Random examples are DeWitt County, IL (not actually a law, but a choice of election official), or Woolfforth TX. Sortition Wiki has other examples, e.g. MP in New Zealand. As defined by Wikipedia, sortition is a necessary implementation of demarchy - It is simply an official sounding name for a process of randomly choosing, which is how demarchy works. But please see Fela's excellent answer - Wikia's definition of demarchy is not necessarily a correct one."
285,Do opinion polls constitute a way of indirect demarchy?,NEGATIVE,"Opinion polls may influence politicians. As opinion polls are based on a random sample of citizens, does this influence constitute an indirect form of demarchy? Of course, it's not real demarchy because politicians may still choose to ignore opinion polls (and often do)."
286,What are the advantages and disadvantages of a politically appointed vs. permanent Civil Service?,NEGATIVE,"The United Kingdom1 has a permanent, and (in theory, at least) politically neutral Civil Service - although it is sometimes argued that this neutrality has been eroded in recent decades. In contrast, in many other countries appointments to the Civil Service are explicitly political, resulting in repeated, widespread changes to the make-up of the state bureaucracy on each change of government. What arguments can be made in favour of, or against, these two models? 1 I don't mean to suggest that the UK is unique in this regard - it just happens to be the country with this model that I'm most familiar with."
287,What is the difference between representative and parliamentary democracy?,NEGATIVE,"In the case of \"representative democracy\", the common sense makes you think that you elect congressmen or speakers to represent your wishes, and in the \"parliamentary democracy\" you do almost the same; so what is the difference?"
288,"",NEGATIVE,"I think the question is not really clear. At first glance it appears to depend on how you define the term demarchy. \"Can such a form of government be called demarchy?\". Hayek first used the term demarchy for something completely unrelated. Later Burnheim in Is democracy possible? uses it when he proposes a form of government that includes the dissolution of the state and sortition, among other things. Some now use it to refer to any form of government that strongly relies on sortition. This is the use that wikipedia makes of the term, in the article you link. In all cases the answer would be: no, I do not believe the presence of opinion polls can be ground of calling a political system a demarchy. (I would avoid the term entirely, as it is ambiguous, and not an accepted term among scholars, who never use it, I recommend to just talk about sortition, to avoid confusion). What perhaps you really meant to ask is: What is the relationship between opinion polls and other uses of sortition in politics? What opinion polls have in common with other forms of sortition is that they somewhat accurately expresses the will and opinion of the people. As you correctly state however, opinion polls are non binding. Politicians routinely ignore them when it so pleases them. In contrast, in many of the past and proposed uses of sortition allotted bodies can make binding decisions. This is not always the case, for example it has most often not be the case for deliberative opinion polls. Furthermore, when talking about sortition usually it is assumed that the selected citizen will have a chance to meet in person, deliberate and often go through an information phase where they get a chance to meet with expert, before making their decision. This way they can make a more informed decision."
289,"",NEGATIVE,"In most cases they are interchangeable concepts. Perhaps one could come up with corner cases where they are not the same, depending on how exactly one defines the terms, but those differences would not be particularly useful and it would be hard to agree on them."
290,Is there any difference between demarchy and stochocracy?,NEGATIVE,"According to the Wikipedia article on demarchy: Demarchy (or lottocracy) is a form of government in which the state is governed by randomly selected decision makers who have been selected by sortition (lot) from a broadly inclusive pool of eligible citizens. According to the Wikipedia article on stochocracy: Stochocracy has been proposed as an alternative form of government to representative democracy. The Iron Law of Oligarchy (see Robert Michels) asserts that democracies gradually devolve towards particracy. Stochocracy aims to reduce this decline by appointing representatives by lot instead of voting. Such a system could also be called lottocracy. To me, they seem the same. Both use sortition to appoint representatives that take decisions. Is there any difference?"
291,"",NEGATIVE,"Demarchy has not an agreed upon meaning. Friedrich Hayek first used the term demarchy to name his proposal of a (according to him) better form of government. He used the term because democracy, in his opinion, is now being used to name forms of government that have not much to do with what it originally was meant to describe. His proposal in no way included the use of sortition. John Burnheim, an Australian philosophy professor, was the first to use the term in relation with sortition. In his book Is democracy possible?, he envisions a form of government that among other things includes the dissolution of the state, and indeed also a large number of citizen juries, selected by lot, that take decisions on public policy issues. He calls his new form of government demarchy. See here for more details. I'm not sure exactly how, but very recently a number of people online have started to use demarchy as a general term used to mean \"sortition based democracy\". One of the first has been the wikipedia article on demarchy. Likely others got it from there. Most people however, specially those really studying the subject, do not use use it this way (usually they do not use it at all). Sortition, in the context of politics, means just allotting any kind of position by random selection. Given the ambiguity around the term demarchy it is, in my opinion, much better to talk about sortition."
292,"",NEGATIVE,"Stochocracy is just an attempt to translate the french word stochocracie, which is a word used to refer to any democracy that uses sortition to select its decision makers.

293,"",NEGATIVE,"First of all do we need to clarify what we mean by politically appointed vs. permanent Civil Service. In each country there are to a certain degree posts in the Civil Service that are career posts to which you ascend by working the system without the need of political friends that would promote you. These posts are considered permanent. On the other hand you have to (in general) a lesser degree the top posts in administrations that are politically appointed. Whether this includes only the minister/secretary or whether it even includes more ranks in a given administration depends from country to country. These positions are to be considered politically appointed. Now to the essence of the question. What arguments can be made in favour of, or against, these two models? As there are no two models that are exactly the same but as they differ all by some degree it is impossible to say which one is clearly better than another, nonetheless can we argue about general, abstract, advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of permanent Civil Service is that no major political decisions will be taken at the administration level so that the whole power lies in the hands of the elected members of government that give the instructions to be followed by the administrations. On the other hand can that also be considered a disadvantage as Civil servants have political opinions too and could thus block political action through their own inaction. This of course only if they disagree with the instructions. Having a stronger emphasis on politically appointed officials lessens this problem but introduces the problem of major overhauls of whole administrations after each election. This diminishes the effectiveness of administrations because they regularly have to adapt to a new leadership. tl;dr: The models differ by degree of political appointments and stronger emphasis on political appointments guarantee that political decisions are not blocked by senior staff but generate a lot of inefficiencies due to changes in leadership on each government change. More emphasis on career Civil Servants leads to more continuous administrations but risk the blocking of initiatives by Civil Servants."
294,"",NEGATIVE,"The current system is indeed unfair to some extent, but pragmatically very effective as ensuring stability. If every state had nuclear weapons then the chance of nuclear war occurring would dramatically increase. If everyone got rid of their nuclear weapons would be that any state could secretly build nuclear weapons use them to bully other states around. The current solution limits both the power of states with nuclear weapons and the chances of nuclear war. The five states recognised as nuclear powers by the treaty may have disagreements, but are exceedingly unlikely to go to war with one another."
296,"",NEGATIVE,"Frankly, the only seemingly well-explained example I found of a pacifist openly discussing the topics on the web (interview with Tripp York, who is a pacifist from Christian standpoint and an author of \"A Faith Not Worth Fighting For: Addressing Commonly Asked Questions about Christian Nonviolence\" from Cascade Books), the answer really was... no answer. When someone asked whether in practice, pacifists merely \"outsource\" the violence to others (e.g. call the cops), his response was that (1) Yes, that is true, and (2) His personal solution to that was \"gardening\". No elaboration was produced on what happens if his family is threatened while gardening - would he NOT call the cops? The same vague approach abounds. For example, when asked about Hitler, his response seems to be summarizable as \"you should speak out, and if necessary get arrested\" (presumably, protesting). How such an approach would have, in any way, shape or form, stop Hitler, is left unaddressed. He also quotes, ironically, Malcolm X. The interview did point out several books which may contain deeper answers, but if those books contained better answers, he surely would have referred to such. \"What About Hitler\" is one. One a more serious note, radical pacifism seems like an implausible approach from game-theoretical viewpoint. It's inherently an unstable strategy. For an example of a great explanation of why, we need look no futher than the classic \"Selfish Gene\" by Richard Dawkins - in \"Aggression: stability and the selfish machine\" chapter he models pacifist (he calls it \"dove\") strategy, and concludes that it is not evolutionary stable - a small minority of hawks (aggressive violent strategists) have a tremendous advantage. Given that human society, as a rule, contains at least 1% psychopaths (source: DSM-IV), pacifism (complete rejection of violence) as a global solution simply can not work - without more nuanced strategies employing aggression, psyhopaths (hawks) will propagate and win till there are ~ 1/2th of population of them. In other words, anything proposed as a solution by radical pacifists is unlikely to actually work in current reality."
297,Is the United States Electoral College constitutional?,NEGATIVE,"A question that has long been standing in my mind is whether the Electoral College is constitutional. Republicans in California, or Democrats in Texas, for that matter, actually do not have a say in the national presidential election. In essence, the electoral college system allows a simple majority in the popular vote to essentially vote in place of the losing party as well. Although AFAIK there is no part of the Constitution where unequal voting is barred, it does seem to contradict the idea of equality present in the current Constitution. Thus the question would be, does it violate the 9th Amendment?"
298,"",NEGATIVE,"Many people use them interchangeably. As far as I'm aware, there's a subtle distinction if one goes by formal definition (which is not always in line with common usage): A parliamentary system is a system of democratic government in which the ministers of the Executive Branch derive their legitimacy from and are accountable to a Legislature or parliament; the Executive and Legislative branches are interconnected. It is a political system in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who can elect people to represent them. (Wiki, emphasis mine). A classical example is of course UK. A representative democracy is merely a system where a small subset of people (representatives) are granted power to legislate/rule on the behalf of the parts of the populace they represent. As such, Every parliamentary system is a representative one (since the Parliament is a form of representation, by definition). However, not every representative system mast be a parliamentary one. For example, presidential system - like USA - have executive branch is 100% independent of legislature."
299,Are there countries considered socialist that do NOT have parliaments and elections?,NEGATIVE,"I know that in USSR, even during the most totalitarian times, there used to be elections and a representative legislative body (Supreme Soviet) - leaving aside the actual competitiveness of the elections or the practical functionality of the Soviet to do anything other than rubber-stamp CPSU decisions. The question is: We re there any countries (in recent history - say, after 500 AD) that can unambiguously be considered Socialist, but which did NOT have a real or pretend representative elected legislative body (where voting is open to a large proportion of the population)? If so, what was the earliest one?"
300,"",NEGATIVE,"Many socialists would argue that a non-democratic state is by definition not socialist, whether it chooses to describe itself as such or not, but moving beyond what could be criticized as a \"No true Scotsman\" argument, we face a serious problem in the definition of the word \"socialist\". The word has been used to describe a broad enough range of political and economic models that it's pretty much impossible to declare any one of them \"unambiguously socialist\" without finding someone who'll vigorously disagree with that classification. However, the Inca Empire (15th-16th century CE), which never had anything approaching an elected legislature, had an economic system which was centrally planned (a common feature of economies laying claim to the name \"socialist\"), and in some respects recognizably redistributive. In particular, the concept of Ayni, roughly translated as \"right (or proper) relationship\", can be seen as analagous to the socialist dictum \"from each according to their ability; to each according to their need\", and was a cornerstone of Inca society, just as it remains an intrinsic part of indigenous Andean culture today. Indeed, the current governing party in Bolivia, the Movimiento al Socialismo (or MAS), while committed to maintaining power by purely democratic means (and, in fact, responsible for an aggressive campaign to increase voter registration throughout the country) has stated that indigenous Andean (and by implication, Inca) culture is inherently socialistic. On a somewhat related note, the current leader of MAS (and Bolivia's current President), Evo Morales, took the unprecedented step of having himself declared Apu Mallku (effectively, \"King\") at Tiwanaku, the seat of the Tiwanaku Empire (which preceded the Inca Empire, and was a strong influence on its culture) on his inauguration as president in 2006, although this is considered a purely symbolic title."
301,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"The Electoral College was created by the Constitution, so I'm pretty sure it's not unconstitutional: Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress (Article 2, Clause 2) I'm not really sure how you're interpreting the 9th Amendment: The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. The amendment was designed to make sure people wouldn't read sections of the Constitution that say things like \"the Government can't do X\" and think \"Apparently the Government would've had that power otherwise; they must have other similar powers, since the Constitution didn't specifically ban those\". I can't see how you could interpret it to mean \"all voters get an equal say in elections\"; that would prescribe a national popular vote, which would make the Constitution internally inconsistent"
302,Does the two-party system influence engagement?,NEGATIVE,"In the last US elections, the voting turnout was approximately 57.5% (Bipartisan Research Center). Over the last few decades, it has been shifting between 50 and 60 percent. This is in stark contrast with various European countries, where the voting turnout rate is significantly higher - 85% and up in some countries (e.g. Denmark, Germany, Sweden) A major difference between the US and many of these countries is the two party system currently present in the United States. This makes me wonder: does the two party system influence voting turnout? Does it provide for poor engagement among the masses? Or is it the other way around? Does poor engagement lead to less incitive to start broader political movement? Has there been any research on the subject? I'd guess that with only two parties, people in the center of the spectrum might not feel as strongly drawn to either side, especially in the suburban middle class. In a system with multiple parties, the chance of there being a party that more accurately represents ones ideals is simply larger."
303,Are there any parliaments with more than two chambers?,NEGATIVE,All parliaments that I know off are either unicameral or bicameral. Wikipedia has articles on tricameral and even tetracameral parliaments. Do any such multicameral parliaments presently exist?
304,What are the main arguments in favour and against general assemblies as legislative bodies?,NEGATIVE,"The Swiss canton of Glarus still practices the concept of the Landsgemeinde. Quoting from Wikipedia: Eligible citizens of the canton meet on a certain day in the open air to decide on laws and expenditures by the council. Everyone can debate a question. Voting is accomplished by those in favour of a motion raising their hands. In Switzerland, this is practiced by the cantons of Glarus and Appenzell-Innerrhoden. The German-language Wikipedia article Gemeindeversammlung tells us that most Swiss municipalities use a similar system, but that details differ locally. The linked English-language article on town meeting describes a number of examples in the United States, although the article on open town meeting seems more similar to what the German language article describes and what is practiced in Switzerland. The examples described here are mostly in New England. What are the main arguments in favour and against decision-taking by general assemblies, compared to other forms of direct democracy?"
305,"",NEGATIVE,According to the List of national legislatures on Wikipedia it does not look like there is any country left that has more than two chambers.
306,"",NEGATIVE,In layman's terms it is often considered that central banks should be independent of politics for the simple reason that the political actors don't trust themselves to make the best long-term decisions. There is a risk of politicians trying to influence a central bank decisions in advance of an election to create short-term economic growth which could in the long-run harm the economy. There are no indications whatsoever that believing in central bank independence or more oversight coincide with traditional political ideologies. Even the National Bank of China (which regulates the yuan) has more leeway than you would imagine in China.
307,Where and how has crowdsourcing been implemented in politics?,NEGATIVE,"The Socialist Party in The Netherlands has previously employed a crowdsourcing website (Dutch-language link) to gather ideas on popular ways to bring down unnecessary health-care costs. Anybody could propose an idea, as well as cast a limited number of votes on other ideas. Among the ideas proposed were to return and use unopened medicine packages to the pharmacy (in particular for expensive prescription medicines) and to reuse mobility scooters. The party was and is in opposition, and I don't know if any of the ideas have been implemented (but the party certainly has relayed a selection of the ideas to parliament). Ironically, the idea of crowdsourcing in politics comes very close to the idea by Mao of take the ideas of the masses (...) and concentrate them, even though the Socialist Party officially discarded maoism in 1975. I wonder if there are other notable examples of the use of crowdsourcing in politics. Internet enables technologies for crowdsourcing that were not available before. Where and how has this been put in practice in politics, if at all? Edit: there are probably numerous examples where groups of civilians can propose ideas that legislators then have to respond to: petitions, initiatives, etc. However, I'm looking for something more interactive where specific problems are solved interactively by the crowd, such as in crowdsourcing. Wikipedia quotes Estellés and González (2012): Crowdsourcing is a type of participative online activity in which an individual, an institution, a non-profit organization, or company proposes to a group of individuals of varying knowledge, heterogeneity, and number, via a flexible open call, the voluntary undertaking of a task. The undertaking of the task, of variable complexity and modularity, and in which the crowd should participate bringing their work, money, knowledge and/or experience, always entails mutual benefit. The user will receive the satisfaction of a given type of need, be it economic, social recognition, self-esteem, or the development of individual skills, while the crowdsourcer will obtain and utilize to their advantage that what the user has brought to the venture, whose form will depend on the type of activity undertaken"
308,"Are there good examples of countries \"incorrectly\" self-identifying as \"socialist\"?",NEGATIVE,"Let's make the following definition: \"Private ownership\" of means of production means 3 things: The profit from selling things produced go to someone dubbed an \"owner\", who is one or more private person (e.g. NOT government/state) The \"owner\" is legally allowed to sell ownership to another person/group of persons. The \"owner\" can decide to stop producing if they feel like it, barring absence of contraindicating legally binding contracts. if you don't think that private ownership of means of production means something different, you can simply mentally call whatever I defined above \"SocioEconomic Condition #1\" instead. This question is about facts, not semantics. Question: Are/were there any countries or governments that officially label(ed) themselves \"Socialist\" but where over 50% of means of production in the country are privately owned as per above definition? (... and there are no official stated plans by the government to drive that share below 50% in the near future) 50% can be measured by GDP produced, or by % of labour force employed. For the purposes of this question, we will ignore the issues of presence or absence of competitive markets, or density of capital accumulation."
309,"Is there any evidence that public transport splitting, corporatisation or privitisation affects quality?",NEGATIVE,"In Europe in the last 10–30 years, many public transportation companies have been split up in parts, with some parts corporatised and some parts privatised. This has partly been motivated by an expected increased in quality, whereas opponents have argued that it would actually reduce quality, but the debate has also been ideologically loaded. Different countries have implemented different things ways, but almost everywhere the trend has been to introduce some form of corporatisation in at least some components of formerly government-run public transportation, most notably state railways. Is there any evidence that splitting up, corporatisation or privatisation of public transportation affects the quality for travellers in a positive or negative way? By splitting I mean distributing the tasks of a formerly unitary organisation over several organisations; for example, one organisation for the tracks, one for the stations, one for the vehicles, one for the operations, etc. By corporatisation I mean the transformation of a government-run public transportation organisation (for example, a ministry of railways) to a for-profit but government-owned corporation. By privatisation I mean the partial or complete transfer of ownership from the government to private actors. By quality, I mean: Reliability with regard to delays and cancellations, specifically the rate of delay, rate of cancellations, Frequency of service: number of trains, buses, etc. per day Speed/duration: some appropriate statistic of the time it takes to go from A to B Price for the traveller, for individual journeys or for subscriptions Service to the traveller: easiness and speed in getting delay compensations, help with lost&amp;found, answers to queries from travellers, easiness of making reservations, etc. One relevant aspect that I will not consider for now relates to the working conditions for the employees of the company. I might take that in another question; I think it's a different thing. Of course, this is not an easy question, because there is no trial we can re-run to see what would have happened if a different policy had been applied. Correlation does not imply causation, and a reduction in quality since the start of corporatisation may very well be due to simultaneous cuts on maintenance. However, this problem in analysis applies to any policy, so all we can do is investigate examples of corporatisation (Sweden, Netherlands), privatisation (United Kingdom), or a maintaining of the status-quo (France). Have there been any studies specifically into this question? What were the results of those studies?"
310,"",NEGATIVE,"My precedence country ( The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ) is the best example, its government characteristics matches with all your description: The president Hugo Chavez declared his government is Socialist or in the route to establish the Socialism.

This article Estructura socio - economica de Venezuela (\"Socio-economic Structure of Venezuela\") is in Spanish but there you can find information related about the companies controlled by the Venezuelan Government. In the next image you can see the proportions between the private and the public sector in Venezuela, in green the private sector which represents 93.23% of the economy, and in white the public sector.

PD2: I tried to answer the most objective I could."

312,Are there any countries with no elections at all?,NEGATIVE,"I was browsing the Wikipedia article on Voting age and the following map struck me. The colours refer to different ages, full legend here: Regardless of other restrictions (only men, only one party, etc.), this map seems to show every single country in the world has some form of elections. Is there any country with no elections at all? See also: Are there countries considered socialist that do NOT have parlaments and elections?"
314,"",NEGATIVE,"Based on this Wiki article and its links: Brunei seems to have no elections (see details in @gerrit's asnwer) Qatar has no elections. But this will presumably no longer be true in 2013 he Consultative Assembly (Majlis as-Shura) has 35 appointed members with only consultative tasks. However, the 2003 Constitution of Qatar calls for a 45 member elected Legislature, which is to be made up of 30 elected representatives and 15 appointed by the Emir. In 2006, Prime Minister Al Thani – then the Deputy PM – announced that elections would be held in 2007. However, only a legislative council to review the subject was created that year. The actual elections have been postponed three times; most recently in June 20103, when the Emir extended the Consultative Assembly's tenure until 2013 Oman is kind of an edge case. You can make arguments that it has elections, and arguments that it does not - the actual process is caucuses selecting representatives, and Sultan appointing them; and the parliamentary body has no true legislative powers either. Saudi Arabia only has municipal level elections, but not country level. Somalia didn't have elections between 1980 and 2012. No longer true as they held an election in 2012. UAE (United Arab Emirates) is another reason to quibble. The Federal National Council (al-Majlis al-Watani al-Ittihadi) is the UAE’s legislative body and consists of 40 members. Half are appointed by the rulers of their respective emirates, and hold all of the council's political power. The other half, who have only advisory tasks and serve two-year terms, are elected by a 6,689-member electoral college whose members are appointed by the emirates."
315,"",NEGATIVE,"The answer depends on \"in theory\" or \"in practice\". Although in theory, elections in Brunei exist, there haven't been any for a long time. According to the Wikipedia article on Politics in Brunei: Under the 1959 constitution there was an elected Legislative Council (Malay: Majlis Mesyuarat Negera), but only one election has ever been held, in 1962. Soon after that election, the assembly was dissolved following the declaration of a state of emergency, which saw the banning of the Brunei People's Party. In 1970 the Council was changed to an appointed body by decree of the Sultan. In 2004 the Sultan announced that for the next parliament, fifteen of the 20 seats would be elected. However, no date for the election has been set."
316,Are there any proposed systems of running the government like a corporation?,NEGATIVE,"Has there ever been a legitimately proposed system whereby either the entire government or the executive branch of it was run the way a corporation is usually supposed to - more specifically, with set performance targets, merit pay and performance bonuses to everyone involved? (USA clearly doesn't count since the President and main people at the top get fixed salary no matter what results). \"legitimately proposed\" is a wee bit subjective, so I will take anything that is more legitimate than \"a random guy ranting on a blog post\" type proposals. Ideally something serious enough to merit publishing a book, or an article in scholarly publication, a Wikipedia article; or attracted an organized group of >100 official supporters, outside Facebook."
318,"",NEGATIVE,"While it may be questionable whether patents are politics are not (actual patent granting is not political, but the whole patent law and IP is a highly political question), Stack Exchange created \"Ask Patents\" site - \"question and answer site for people interested in improving the patent system\".

319,Was Hitler's regime a right-wing regime?,NEGATIVE,"Left- and right-wing ideologies seem to change over time. From what I've read so far, the Nazi regime was considered a right-wing party at that time by the people who voted it. But currently, right-wing activists reject it based on economic grounds. They claim there was no free market, competition etc. But is this really an argument? Because a free market can exist in both leftist and rightist systems. However, I think it tends to degenerate in their extremes. Specifically, a far-left regime will end up granting to much control to the goverment (communism), while a far-right regime should theoretically end up in grating all the power to the wealthiest person(s), so the result is the same. Unlike communism, I'm not aware of the existence of any far-right governments in the present day. Leaving aside economics, which seem common to both wings, could the Nazis be labeled as right-wing because of their social views (e.g. \"The strong has the natural right to rule the weak\")?"
320,What form of government does StackExchange resemble?,NEGATIVE,"It's not representative democracy, because the decisions are taken by the entire community, but they are weighted :P The closest one that comes into my mind is the \"Venus project\" :)"
321,"",NEGATIVE,"I would say it resembles a meritocracy of a consultative nature. The more reputation you have (the more merit), the more influence. A new user with 1 rep can neither vote nor comment. All they can do is ask and answer questions, so they have no decision influence whatsoever. As reputation increases (ultimately as decided by the community), users get more and more power. This only breaks down when it comes to ♦ moderators, which are elected — but again, only by users that have proven their merit by earning at least 150 reputation. Edit: as pointed out in comments and other answers, finally the community power is only of a consultative nature. The owners can choose to follow recommendations or not. They usually do, but ultimately, true power is with the SE company. Nevertheless, as long as the company listens to the community, people in the community still have influence, which is quite similar to power."
322,"",NEGATIVE,"I think this question illustrates that a simple division of politics in left and right is an oversimplification. One may find that people use left to describe either pacifist, anarchist idealists, whereas other people would classify the Soviet Union as left; the two are very different. Likewise, people may describe Ron Pauls ultra-libertarian ideas as right-wing, but also nazism as far-right; the two are again very different. So phrases like left and right are simply insufficient to describe political positions. The diversity in answers to this question, as well as the controversy of my answer there (presently +13 -6) also illustrates that the meaning of the phrases left and right are subjective. Personally, I would describe any military dictatorship as far right, but that would be the in the fascism sense of the word, not in the ultra-libertarian sense. As to more explicitly answer your question: could the nazis be labeled as right-wing because of their social views? — in my opinion, yes. In fact, that is what my controversial answer boils down to — in that answer, I characterise the left-right scale as horizontal vs. vertical power structures. In that interpretation, the strong rule the weak would certainly fall to the far right. Side-note: One definition of fascism I have seen jocularly defines fascism as any political idea one violently disagrees with ;). Maybe in the US right the word socialism has supplanted this meaning ;)"
323,"Are worker cooperatives socialist, capitalist, or their own category?",NEGATIVE,"This question inquires about private ownership vs. state ownership. However, there is a 3rd category that may or may not be considered as private ownership: Worker cooperatives. In the model of private or public ownership, where would worker cooperatives fit in? Is this ownership model closer to socialism, closer to capitalism, or is it its own category entirely? What political movements promote this form of ownership? Bonus question that is probably off-topic on this site: Do worker cooperatives make up a significant (>5%) share of the economy anywhere in the world?"
324,"",NEGATIVE,"One could argue that cooperatives are not private ownership, but that would be futile. Such an argument would mean that owning stock could also not be private ownership. Worker cooperatives are in effect private ownership as they belong to the members of the cooperative. They are closer to capitalism than to socialism because in a pure socialist world everything would be needed to be controlled by the government. A pure socialist world could not allow for cooperatives to exist as they are a step in the direction of capitalism. The model is thus closer to capitalism as there are no rules that prohibit cooperatives from making revenue and that revenue increases the capital stock which in turn belongs to the members of the cooperative (or the stock holders). A cooperative is thus only a simpler form of a stock company. Still mostly socialist parties promote this form of ownership as they see it as a first step of giving up parts of control over a company from a simple board to a wider population of members. Yet as has been shown above this is simply a question about how a company or a cooperative is governed and not about whom it belongs to. Regarding the bonus question, I can't tell and a quick google search did not turn anything up either."
326,"",NEGATIVE,"The question by and large doesn't make sense as you are asking if the particular structure of what is in essence a company fits into a description of a type of governmental system. For sake of argument if we treat a company as if it were a government then a workers cooperative would most closely resemble Communism. All workers have equal ownership and stakes in the venture. Many successful cooperatives are evidence that a communist system works well in small groups, however as the number of people increase they become harder to manage and degenerate into a typical communist regime."
327,Is there any rational alternative besides the Democracy?,NEGATIVE,"At the moment the most spread system in the world is the democracy with different accents, some parliamentary, some representative, other presidential, etc. But recently I have asked my self if exist any political system currently being used but not being a explicit democracy but having some characteristics of it like: A high representation of the people will. Without the bi-partidism sin. And without the typical election every n year. With the respect of Human Rights and Civil Liberties."
328,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"Power in Stack Exchange is not held by its users, but delegated to them by the owners of the SE network - for example, the users are afforded no formal mechanism by which to change the \"constitution\" or rules by which SE sites operate, or to decide, for example, to open source the code on which the sites run. In that respect it could be said to resemble a form of Executive Monarchy in which power is technically wielded by an absolute ruler (who chooses not to exercise all of their power directly). Alternatively, one could consider the mechanisms by which SE sites operate as analogous to physical laws, in which case the owners of the SE network are effectively deities, able to change the nature of the universe by fiat. That, I think, would make the technical staff angels, and moderators a kind of priesthood, responsible for interpreting divine law, and mediating between the mortal realm and the heavens. Since there are, however, some democratic (or meritocratic, as suggested by @gerrit) elements to the governance of this mortal realm - election of moderators, and so on - one model to which SE could be said to bear a slight resemblance is the Democracy/Theocracy amalgam of Iran (with, admittedly, many differences, not least of which is that Wikipedia does not appear to be contemplating an invasion of SE to prevent us from getting nukes)."
329,"",NEGATIVE,"Let me make something incredibly clear up front: While I come across as rather angry, I'm not. I'm very happy with the way the SE network is run, and while I disagree with SE on many things, we've agreed to bury the hatchet because the bickering is not productive if it goes on for months at a time. As a friend of mine just pointed out, it's technically a form of Despotism. Stack Exchange, Inc has the final say in everything that goes on in this site. Here is why I say that: First, SE, Inc has complete control of the websites source code. Second, while they generally leave the community to it's own devices, and the government of the city-states/provinces to the community elected moderators, occasionally they need to interfere for whatever reason (legal, nobody can agree, etc). So in some ways, it's a meritcracy. In some ways, it's a democratic republic, since we have a constitution (as encoded in the FAQ of each respective site, and enshrined in Meta.StackOverflow). But when you get down to it, all this exists at the whim of the \"dictators\", SE, Inc."
330,"",NEGATIVE,"Right after the American Revolution, a bunch of sovereign countries like \"Virginia,\" \"Massachusetts,\" and \"New York\" all decided to be a federation of countries. They wouldn't charge taxes on each other, and they'd try to make laws that the individual countries could each adopt on their own. It was called \"the Articles of Confederation\" and the idea was that these independent countries would try to get along, but wouldn't give up any of their rights. It lasted only a few years, then they gave up and decided that they needed a Constitution, and some central authority. After WWII, a bunch of countries in Europe tried to do the same thing. They decided to try to agree on some laws without giving up any rights. In 1990, they even went so far as to give up their own money, and all share the same kind of dollar bill, called a Euro. But, they never actually came up with one guy to call the shots. So, the Greeks and the Italians kept spending as much money as they wanted, and forced Germany to pay all their bills. And now, they are wondering why Germany is looking towards a tighter Constitution, and more central authority."
331,"",NEGATIVE,"The Kingdom of Bhutan is a fully functioning monarchy, and in spite of that ranks very high in what it calls \"Gross National Happiness.\" To be sure, it is a benign dictatorship, one in which the monarch makes quite a show of being concerned for his subjects. Historically, this paternalistic approach to governance has actually been the norm. It wasn't always as good as hoped for, but most rulers desired to see the needs of their people be well met. Additionally, Isaac Asimov once postulated a United States in which the \"best\" person was selected by a computer to be President, after neutrally testing any applicants who desired to run. The crux of the story was that in one year's cycle, the computer refused to pick anyone, because no one was fully up to the task. There is nothing that says that people necessarily choose the \"best\" person for the job. Indeed, being too much of a policy wonk may help the government run better, but still fail to capture the people's love. Mario Monti, Prime Minister of Italy, is often called a \"technocrat,\" and widely heralded by pundits as a result, but is almost certain to be defeated in the next election. A match-up against his predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi, held in any kind of public forum, would have been a massacre. But when bond yields plummeted, Monti made good. Indeed, it is real work to be an active participant in one's own governance, and so one could argue that if happiness (utility in economic terms) were the only desired outcome, then a despot attuned to the needs and wants of his people is actually a better system. Unfortunately, as Madison said, \"if men were angels, we wouldn't need government in the first place.\" As such, such benign dictatorships, while definitely the model of Plato, are rare in practice. And thus, pragmatically, representative democracy's advantage of incentivizing the goal of looking after the people by giving it power as a reward tends to eventually win out. In the word of Winston Churchill, \"Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.\""
332,"",NEGATIVE,"Typically when we hear about accepted forms of government and being a member of the \"Free World\" as it is called it is typically encouraged for the government to have more democratic measures. The United States as leader of the \"Free World\" so to speak of course has vested interests in expanding its allies, promoting its security, and encouraging trade. Typically Democracy is encouraged as it is the most fair (and most predictable) of three basic types of government. Autocratic: Ruled by a single leader unanimously. Dictatorships, Monarchies, etc... Good examples are North Korea and Syria. The countries actions are unpredictable and may or may not favor the political, defense, or economic goals of first world nations. Oligarchies: Ruled by a small but powerful group of individuals that set policy and lead the country. They usually have a figure head leader that changes from time to time. Good examples include modern China. Also hard to influence the direction of the country and may be unpredictable. Democracy: Ruled by elected representatives in which all citizens have a right to choose their leaders. It is by its very nature the most fair, although minority groups may get trampled easily. Good example includes USA, India or Japan. These tend to favor capitalism and market forces the most and tend to be mostly predictable, though not always easily controllable. Democracies are ideal to the capitalist driven free market model that is typically pushed by such \"Free World\" institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF. The important thing to note however is that other types of governments have throughout history been accepted by the Democratic free world. Egypt Mubarak was supported financially and militarily by the United States for a time because he was predictably against military conflict with Israel. The Post WWII Greek Monarchy Shortly after WWII a communist uprising occurred in Greece, where the United Kingdom and the United States supported the reinstatement of the old Monarchy. He was a Far-Right monarch that predictably was anti-communist, and was open to foreign investments from wealthy capitalists. The United States supported a government that tortured and executed its own citizens and was ruled by a single man. There are also exceptions where true democracies are more or less not accepted by members of the free world because of socialist or nationalist policies that its citizens had more or less voted in favor of. Venezuela Is a democracy with elections and representative leaders, however it is painted with a rather negative light because of the highly nationalistic and socialistic tendencies of its elected leaders. Venezuela is restrictive of foreign capitalist investments which makes it an enemy of the IMF and the World Bank as well as wealthy capitalists that tend to have a lot of influence in first world democracies."
333,"",NEGATIVE,"There are numerous and almost overwhelming evidence that privatization of public run services typically cause: An enormous decrease in quality An enormous increase in price to those who utilize or benefit from the service Corruption and profiteering Privatization of Prisons in the US, Failed Promises: https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/%28S%28403tz1ng3oz0k355yuvexj45%29%29/displayArticle.aspx?articleid=23838&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 Here is an example of extreme corruption in a case that happened in my backyard: http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/08/11/139536686/pa-judge-sentenced-to-28-years-in-massive-juvenile-justice-bribery-scandal Here is a paper written on the reality of privatization of public infrastructure: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1776350 At best it becomes a short term solution for cash strapped governments, but then they slowly find that various provisions protect the private organizations from inherent risk in such a project, it doesn't end up being as good a deal anymore for the government. A small example of what I am talking about is how a sports league has a crumbling stadium in a city. The free market would demand that the league or the league team invest in a new stadium for their fans or they will take their business elsewhere. This is not what happens. They exploit the local municipality to purchase and take the risk of building them a new stadium, then giving them the exclusive lease for it the lifetime of the building. They typically blackmail the municipality by threatening to leave the city, which in turn brings the citizens against the city for not meeting the demands. Rail systems will have the same problem, the privatization portion of it typically just takes the recurring annual managing expenses off of government books, but when rail infrastructure needs to be built or replaced then the enormous investment is typically more than a private enterprise wants to take on so a government will end up floating bonds to pay for it in the end anyway. Other reasons for privatization can be as simple as union busting tactics: https://www.commondreams.org/headline/2012/10/02-4 Privatization of Social Security is another thing that is a thinly veiled power play to grab an enormous pot of money into the hands of fund managers and Wall Street banks for them to gamble with. We see how well the pensions are doing, and we also see that when a pension fails the government is often forced to pick up the tab while the people who mismanaged that money (gambled it) are heralded as free market Ubermenchen and model citizens to which we should all aspire to be some day by working hard. Here is an example of the Right-Wing Cato Institute heralding the success of measures to privatize Chile's social security system (the Right Wing's breeding ground for ideas) http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/pr-ja-jp.html Then there are a number of articles in the news recently that show they are facing the same problems as many pensions do today. Where did the money go? http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/01/chile_confronts.html http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/12/10/chiles-privatized-social-security-may-risk-bankruptcy/8842/ I believe the evidence is overwhelming that there exist a number of public services that cannot be efficiently or privatized without governments picking up the cost or without inherent risk of corruption. It is a no-brainer for a business man who has a captive consumer base, a governments shoulders to fall back on and guaranteed profit. The temptation for corruption is insatiable for members of the government as well when this occurs."
334,"",NEGATIVE,"It's a mixed / hybrid goverment, integrating elements from almost every one of the basic forms of government. At the heart of Stack Exchange communities there is a token economy, the reputation system, which allows for a certain degree of self governing, a trait that points to meritocracy and timocracy. It's also a trait that, if left unchecked, may (and have in isolated instances) lead to plutocracy. There are also strong democratic elements, the Meta process resembles a deliberative assembly1, and has at times been used to define policies, hold referendums, and protest decisions. The election of community moderators, representatives of their respective communities, is also a deeply democratic process. Network wide, each Stack Exchange site has a degree of autonomy, and per site Metas can be considered a form of local assembly, with Meta Stack Overflow being a grand assembly (of sorts). This arrangement is skewed in favour of Stack Overflow and the larger sites of the network in general, due to various historical and practical reasons2, and it's a bit reminiscent of a commonwealth, or perhaps colonial structures, such as internal colonialism and neocolonialism. At the end of the day, though, Stack Exchange Inc. has final say in all matters, and if we assume Stack Exchange Inc. as a single entity then we are talking about a benevolent dictatorship, a (mostly benign) authoritarian form of government. 1 ...or a Roman Arena, depending on perspective. 2 Population, for example."
335,"",NEGATIVE,"Your question is in fact open-ended, because every social system can be considered rational from at least the point of view of the ruling group. If the rational is the synonym of planned, than the communistic system was fully rational. It was based on the intelectual speculation, but it wasn't as effective in practice as it promised to be. Rational as the rule of the reason - this definition makes the democracy one of the least rational systems - it is based mostly on emotions, not the reason. Its emotionality is caricaturized by Plato, who proposed the dictature of the reason - the system that have nothing to do with what is called democracy."
336,"",NEGATIVE,"These terms vary greatly by country. In the US, currently \"left\" is identified with people that believe in: Redistribution of wealth by means of taxation and welfare spending Expansive treatment of rights - i.e. right to housing, right to specific level of income, right to medical care, etc. Positivist approach to rights (government can create or destroy rights) Laissez-faire governmental approach to social life and public morals Government control for the behaviors that are considered harmful to the society, and governmental encouragement of the behaviors that are considered beneficial for the society More diplomatic and appeasing approach to international conflicts Primacy of international law and mores over the national peculiarities and traditions Collectivism more than individualism On the other hand, the \"right\" is identified with: Laissez-faire approach to economic activity Restricting the role of the government to ensuring economic activities are not violating the rules of \"fair play\" but not promoting any specific goals or activities Private responsibility for one's welfare Governmental and public control over morals and social life Great reverence to tradition, religion, etc. Negativist approach to rights (rights are absence of violation of small number of principles) More forceful and aggressive approach to international matters, including intervention in places that do not directly influence internal US matters Nationalism and primacy of national law and mores over the international ones Reducing taxation and discouraging using taxation for governmental projects beyond defense, internal policing and such Individualism more than collectivism You may notice that some of these items seem somewhat contradictory or inconsistent, and some are vague. This is what it is - people do hold contradictory or inconsistent beliefs and some of their positions are vague or fluid. You may also notice many people that vote right hold some left views, and many people that vote left have right views. That happens a lot. About the \"extreme\" and \"far\" labels - except for a small variety of cases (like neo-nazis, anarchist gangs and such) they usually mean exactly nothing. In 99.9% cases this label would be applied by a politician to an opposing politician and would mean no more than \"this is a very bad man, you should vote for me, not for him\"."
337,"",NEGATIVE,"The Nazi party was called Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers' Party). As you can note, if you remove \"German\", you could apply this label to any number of current left-wing parties, and it would fit nicely. No right-wing party I know calls itself \"Socialist\" or \"Workers'\", though some do call themselves \"National\". Nazis themselves insisted they are the right (as in, \"correct\") socialist party - as opposed to the wrong socialist party, the Bolsheviks. Name, however, does not define the ideology. Actions do. Let us consider the main traits of the Nazi regime: Extreme nationalism. This can be and were, in history, component both of right and left parties. Totalitarian control over the information and enforcement of specific ideology, leaving no space for dissent. This is a trait of many left-wing regimes, such as communist ones, but not exclusively. Strict governmental control over the economy, while leaving the means of production formally private. This places them at the left - while many left ideologies want to remove private ownership completely, others are content with mere control and not outright ownership. Publicly Nazis were opposed to capitalism, associated it with Jews and vigorously attacked it. Private ownership was greatly restricted and some property - like land - while formally owned, could not be sold or used contrary to the wishes of the state. Overall, this is associated with left-wing ideology. Women rights - Nazis ideas about women's place were \"Kinder, Küche, Kirche\" (children, kitchen, church) which places them at the far right. Other minority rights were similarly non-existent with them. Religious matters - Nazis were relatively tolerant to religions that not interfered with their goals, while vigorously persecuting ones that opposed them. Both left and right did that, so here we do not have definite difference. Relationship between the individual and the state - the Nazis were very collectivist (where the collective is the nation), which places them on the left. I would say that economically Nazis were on the left, though not as far left as, say, communists, while socially they were on the very far right."
338,(Why) does the US left promote federal powers over state powers?,NEGATIVE,"This comment states that the modern left is often promoting federal powers over state powers. I assume that the comment relates to the United States. It surprises me, because in (northern) Europe, some left-wing and most hard-left parties are quite critical of the European Union, arguing that democracy works better on a smaller scale level, that a strong concentration of power is bad (e.g. increases susceptibility to corporate corruption), that the European Union is mostly a neoliberal project, among other arguments. Examples include Socialistische Partĳ in The Netherlands, Vänsterpartiet in Sweden, Die Linke in Germany, PCF in France, etc. Danish People's Movement against the EU sits with the European United Left group. Jeremy Corbyn in the UK has also historically been quite lukewarm about the EU. This is unlike centrist parties, such as the ones by Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder, which often strongly endorse any (federalist) plans from the EU. Do left-wing parties in the USA promote federal powers over state powers? If so, what is the reasoning behind this? Is this just a remnant of state powers being a substitute for southern states wanting to maintain first slavery, then segregation, or is there some more fundamental reason behind this?"
339,"",NEGATIVE,"As others have pointed out, rational is relative. There is no absolute answer to this question, but it may be instructive to compare countries with different systems. As a disclaimer: comparisons always fail because countries have different backgrounds. Therefore, any conclusions from comparisons need to be taken with a pinch of salt. Cuba is a dictatorship that self-identifies as socialist. In many international rankings, it doesn't do so poorly. For example, Cuba has a high human development and is often considered to have one of the best healthcare and education systems in the developing world. By comparison, neighbouring Haiti has been a shaky democracy since some decades, ridden by coup d'etats, and has a low human development with many serious problems. On the other hand, Costa Rica also does pretty well considering its material wealth, but perhaps with more poverty than Cuba (hard to find reliable figures). Costa Rica has been a stable democracy since the 1950s and doesn't seem to do significantly better or worse than Cuba. As an interesting side note, Costa Rica abolished its army in the 1950s and has since then been one of the few countries in the region to have no wars and no coup d'etats, something that might have contributed to its stability. China is a dictatorship in transition from a planned to a market economy (but see also this question). In recent years its economy has grown significantly. Although many people live in poverty or work in very poor conditions, the standard of living has quite strongly improved in recent decades. It has a higher HDI than India, and the difference in IHDI is even larger. India has been a democracy for quite a while, and is growing like China, but presently seems to have more and more severe poverty than China. Although some political analysts in the west have predicted that economic growth and economic freedoms necessarily lead to democratisation and an increase in political freedoms, I'm not sure if there is much evidence for this in China. Now, this is not an argument against democracy, and in a correlative study, I'm pretty sure democracies would turn out to do statistically better than dictatorships (but correlation does not imply causation). One reason western democracies are rich may be because of the cheap labour in eastern and southern dictatorships, or at least poorer countries. But the comparisons above may indicate that democracy is not the only system that has the potential to provide a decent and improving quality of life for citizens."
341,"",NEGATIVE,"I don't believe that members of the Left believe this at all. It is commonly accepted that in US politics, the States are the proving ground for new ideas, like how recreational marijuana use is now legal (at the State level) in both Washington state and Colorado, which is supported partially by the Democratic party and fully supported by the far Left Green Party. Coincidentally it is also supported by the majority of Libertarians as well. Two factors at play I think play into this belief. The Left in the United States believe in a strong Federal government over matters of regulation. Some people who view politics as a black and white thing will see strong support for the Federal Government as Anti-State government. Furthermore many on the Right are against new regulations and against much of the Federal government as it stands now, including what they view as out-of-control spending and extreme crippling taxes. Their strategy for coping with what they perceive as major problems with the Federal government are to offload power and responsibilities to the individual States. To form a unified opposition to such ideals, they will commonly paint Leftist opposition to such policies as Supporters of Big Government and thus Anti-State government. Their policy strategy is such that affecting major policy changes that they desire are not politically achievable at the Federal level, but offloading responsibility to the States makes it easier to slowly push for the budget cuts and tax cuts for wealthy Americans on a State by State level which is more possible to achieve.&nbsp; It is hard to say how history affected this mindset. Traditionally the Democrats were the party of slavery and states rights while the Republicans were the party of a strong Federal government and promotion of a strong Republic. This continued up until about the Civil Rights era where we started to see a shift in party ideals. Republicans became the party of business and frugality, where Democrats became the party of the Workers and minorities. About the time where this minority shift happened, the Democrats lost common cause and we started to see a gradual migration of southern states to the Republicans. To this day, southern Democrats are a dying breed."
342,"",NEGATIVE,"This is largely (but not 100%) correct. There are at least 5 reasons why the Left by and large promotes Federal power over state power: The goals and projects they desire are significantly diminished if they ONLY apply to parts of the country, due to inter-state mobility. If you raise taxes in New York State, tons of high-income people from NY will move to CT, or Delaware, or whatnot. If you enact onerous regulations on hedge funds in NY, the hedge funds will move to Connecticut. (both of those examples reflect what actually happened in recent history). However, if you apply the same laws, rules and taxes federally, there will be a LOT less people/corporations either willing or able to move outside USA to escape them. Many of the issues near and dear to the Left are regional ones (for example, energy production), with the states where they want to cause impact NOT being Left wing stronghold. They can't force coal producers in Appalachia to change their ways by working on a state level, but they can by increasing the power that the Federal government has. Another good example of this is illegal immigrants. People voting in border states who don't particularly wish to feel the negatives of a bunch of criminals come through where they live can not be convinced that illegal immigration is somehow a Good Thing. So it's easier to enforce pro-illegal policies on Federal level, backed up by the votes from people whose only negative exposure to illegals is deciding on whether to pay taxes on their illegal nanny/gardener. A large part of the Left's political strategy in USA has - in 20th century - been to influence \"the elites\". It is a lot easier to influence an insulated circle of power brokers in Washington DC than a more diffuse set of state level power brokers. A guy in State Senate from BumpkinCity, Wherever is a lot less susceptible to \"If you oppose this 'cool' issue, you will be ostracized and not invited to any of our parties, and panned negatively in New York Times and Washington Post\" More generically, the Left ideas and worldview are super-concentrated in very few localities (this is fractal in nature - even down to individual states. You have a left-leaning large city, surrounded by right-leaning farmland or suburbs or sparsely populated area). Therefore, the more you disperse the power, the less territory will be \"left\" on aggregate. This is especially potent in light of #1 and #2. The Left - ever since the time of French Revolution - strongly believe in Enlightened Rulers driving forward the country of No-So-Enlightened-or-Bright populace. (the quintessential example of that view was of course the 2008 brouhaha over Obama's \"clinging to their guns\" comments when speaking to his supporters, but you get the same thing if you hang out on any random politics forum). With such worldview, giving more power to said enlightened elite is a Good Thing in general. Please note that I said \"by and large\". When the left - on the practical level - sees the same downsides to Federal control of their pet issues as described above - they instantly want LESS Federal power on that issue and to make it a State one. A stereotypical example of such would be drug/pot legalization."
343,"",NEGATIVE,"Worker cooperatives are independent of socialist/capitalist classification. What matters to being socialist/capitalist is whether the workers in the cooperative: Can retain the profit from selling whatever they produce (no matter how it's divided internally) Can decide what and how to produce Can elect (assuming they have 100% internal agreement) to sell the cooperative to ANOTHER owner, who will then be deciding how the place is run and getting the profits. If the answers to all 3 are \"yes\", it's typical capitalism. If the answers to all 3 are \"no\", it's typical hardline socialism. Please note that in may nominally \"socialist\" countries, small cooperatives would have freedom to do one of the 3 (usually #1 only, or #1 and #2, but NOT #3)."
344,"",NEGATIVE,"I will list the main two disadvantages: It is hard/impossible to scale well. Especially when we include discussions. Physically, you can't fit all that many people together and allow either discussions or even accurate voting. Electronically, you have issues with authentication etc... This is exactly why you see such an approach used for small town meetings or small Swiss cantons. How are you going to organize an assembly of all eligible voters of Texas, USA? In physical presence assemblies, the people who can physically intimidate others have too much power. I'm not going to vote openly against slavery reparations when there are a couple of 6'3\" 200lb bodibuilder type black guys standing near me glaring angrily, no matter what my opinions as a short small white person are. Especially if we are talking about small community where people know where you live. Please note that the latter is the main reason why pro-Union left wants a so-called \"card check\" legislation in USA and anti-union right does not. The MAIN thrust of the legislation is to abolish secret voting to establish union in a factory. The objections to that is that the union thugs would - in absence of secret ballots - intimidate people into voting pro-union (lest someone states that it is merely overactive paranoid imagination of right wing, look at the statistics - a LOT more people vote (openly, when directly canvassed in person by Union organizers) to support the \"should we have a union vote\" motions; than people who vote to instantiate the union in subsequent secret ballot voting."
345,What evidence did the Bush administration have that Iraq stored WMD?,NEGATIVE,"The U.S. and its allies have justified the Iraq war, among other things, by citing the danger of weapons of mass destruction. According to wikipedia (emphasis mine) the U.S. stated that the intent was to remove \"a regime that developed and used weapons of mass destruction, that harbored and supported terrorists, committed outrageous human rights abuses, and defied the just demands of the United Nations and the world\" What was it that made them believe Iraq was holding WMD arsenals and/or was developing them? Specially in consideration of the fact that no big amount of such weapons have ever been found. (This of course does not necessarily mean they do not exist, or that the suspicions where not justified)."
346,"",NEGATIVE,"Other things aside, Saddam HAD in the past developed and actually used (against Kurds in Iraq) chemical weapons. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_poison_gas_attack He also used them against Iran in Iraq-Iran war. Also, he either refused to abide by UNSCOM inspections or, when he pretended to let them in to ease off international pressure, would NOT grant them access to the most critical locations, or delayed them for long times with evidence that the locations were being 'sanitized' before the inspectors arrived. Also, people who had nothing to do with Bush Administration believed the same thing. A couple random quotes (please note that many predate Bush's election as President and can't even be blamed on 'Bush told CIA to mislead every other dumb politician in USA and foreign leader' usual argument): “Even today, Iraq is not nearly disarmed. Based on highly credible intelligence, UNSCOM [the U.N. weapons inspectors] suspects that Iraq still has biological agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, and clostridium perfringens in sufficient quantity to fill several dozen bombs and ballistic missile warheads, as well as the means to continue manufacturing these deadly agents. Iraq probably retains several tons of the highly toxic VX substance, as well as sarin nerve gas and mustard gas. This agent is stored in artillery shells, bombs, and ballistic missile warheads. And Iraq retains significant dual-use industrial infrastructure that can be used to rapidly reconstitute large-scale chemical weapons production.” — Ex-Un Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter in 1998 “The community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat Iraq poses now: a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them or provide them to terrorists. If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow.” — Bill Clinton in 1998 “Saddam’s goal … is to achieve the lifting of U.N. sanctions while retaining and enhancing Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs. We cannot, we must not and we will not let him succeed.” — Madeline Albright, 1998, Clinton's Secretary of State. “(Saddam) will rebuild his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and some day, some way, I am certain he will use that arsenal again, as he has 10 times since 1983″ — Clinton's National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, Feb 18, 1998 “Iraq is not the only nation in the world to possess weapons of mass destruction, but it is the only nation with a leader who has used them against his own people.” — Tom Daschle in 1998 “As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations. Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.” — Nancy Pelosi, December 16, 1998 “What is at stake is how to answer the potential threat Iraq represents with the risk of proliferation of WMD. Baghdad’s regime did use such weapons in the past. Today, a number of evidences may lead to think that, over the past four years, in the absence of international inspectors, this country has continued armament programs.” — Jacques Chirac, October 16, 2002 'I am absolutely convinced that there are weapons...I saw evidence back in 1998 when we would see the inspectors being barred from gaining entry into a warehouse for three hours with trucks rolling up and then moving those trucks out.' -- Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Cohen in April of 2003 “[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq’s refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.” — From a letter signed by Joe Lieberman, Dianne Feinstein, Barbara A. Milulski, Tom Daschle, &amp; John Kerry among others on October 9, 1998 “This December will mark three years since United Nations inspectors last visited Iraq. There is no doubt that since that time, Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer- range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.” — From a December 6, 2001 letter signed by Bob Graham, Joe Lieberman, Harold Ford, &amp; Tom Lantos among others “In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.” — Hillary Clinton, October 10, 2002 “Whereas Iraq has consistently breached its cease-fire agreement between Iraq and the United States, entered into on March 3, 1991, by failing to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction program, and refusing to permit monitoring and verification by United Nations inspections; Whereas Iraq has developed weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological capabilities, and has made positive progress toward developing nuclear weapons capabilities” — From a joint resolution submitted by Tom Harkin and Arlen Specter on July 18, 2002 “Iraq made commitments after the Gulf War to completely dismantle all weapons of mass destruction, and unfortunately, Iraq has not lived up to its agreement.” — Barbara Boxer, November 8, 2002, one of the most liberal US Democratic Senators. “The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retained some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capability. Intelligence reports also indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons, but has not yet achieved nuclear capability.” — Robert Byrd, October 2002 “There’s no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat… Yes, he has chemical and biological weapons. He’s had those for a long time. But the United States right now is on a very much different defensive posture than we were before September 11th of 2001… He is, as far as we know, actively pursuing nuclear capabilities, though he doesn’t have nuclear warheads yet. If he were to acquire nuclear weapons, I think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we.” — Wesley Clark on September 26, 2002 “Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction. Iraq’s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.” — Al Gore, 2002 “We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.” — Bob Graham, December 2002 “We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.” — Ted Kennedy, September 27, 2002 “I will be voting to give the president of the United States the authority to use force – if necessary – to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.” — John F. Kerry, Oct 2002 “The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us since the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know after Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that he has continued to build those weapons. He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, allowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on weapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation.” — John Kerry, October 9, 2002 “Whether one agrees or disagrees with the Administration's policy towards Iraq, I don't think there can be any question about Saddam's conduct. He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do. He lies and cheats; he snubs the mandate and authority of international weapons inspectors; and he games the system to keep buying time against enforcement of the just and legitimate demands of the United Nations, the Security Council, the United States and our allies. Those are simply the facts.” — Henry Waxman, Oct 10, 2002"
347,Are political parties based on ethnicity democratic?,NEGATIVE,Does a political party based on a minor (or major) ethnicity have a place in democracy ?
348,"",NEGATIVE,"In my opinion Yes absolutely however it can be sign of deep social and cultural turmoil when this starts to occur on a large scale. Political parties should form around a common set of beliefs, and if a particular minority ethnicity in a nation feels that its people are not being represented well or that this ethnicities values are going unheard then forming an ethnic party becomes a healthy democratic outlet for government activism. This is much preferable to the alternative of ethnic minorities being ignored or shunned from politics, or for revolts, terrorism or full scale civil war to occur. Because ethnic minorities are a minority by overall population, ethnic parties around minority groups generally must form coalitions with other minority parties that they share some similarities with to gain any type of meaningful power in the parliamentary system. This encourages other ethnic parties as well as tradtitional parties to work closely and compromise with one another to achieve common goals. This collaboration encourages good relations between different ethnicities in the same country. Are Ethnic Parties preferred? Probably not. The best political party is one that is not exclusive based on race, creed, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation but then it is not always possible for an ethnic minority to be accurately represented in any other way. It should be worrisome that minority groups feel that certain elements of the society or culture exclude them or do not closely represent them in any meaningful way. The most worrisome would be if an ethnic party formed around the majority ethnicity as this can spell Majority Tyranny against minority groups in the country. Based on the cultural makeup of the citizenry however, ethnic parties can make sense in the democratic process."
350,"",NEGATIVE,"Depends on what you mean by \"have a place\". In a true liberal democracy, people have freedom to associate by any principle they want, including the principle of belonging to a specific ethnicity, religion, ideology, sexual preferences or soccer team tastes. However, if such party would advocate preferential treatment of certain ethnicity by the state, it should not be allowed to turn this advocacy into the law. The easiest way of doing this is to avoid electing such people into power and generally shunning them and shaming them out of the political scene. However, it is virtually impossible to ensure such party would not be able to prevail - ultimately, the people are the sovereign, so if most of the people want it, it will happen one way or another. However, such actions - i.e. preference of certain ethnicity by the state - are definitely incompatible with the modern democracy. Thus, for citizens that value the modern democracy it is prudent to avoid such parties by all means and ensure they never have a chance to gain any power. Fortunately, in most current liberal democracies ethnic parties are mostly bothered with, in the best case, preventing ethnic discrimination, and in the worst case - trading votes for the parts of the budget directed to the projects they see to disproportionally benefit their ethnicity. As such, they do not pose much danger to the democracy."
351,Which are the symptoms of a decadent Democracy degenerating to Ochlocracy?,NEGATIVE,"The Ochlocracy is by the Wikipedia's definition: Or mob rule is government by mob or a mass of people, or the intimidation of legitimate authorities. As a pejorative for majoritarianism, it is akin to the Latin phrase mobile vulgus meaning \"the fickle crowd\", from which the English term \"mob\" was originally derived in the 1680s. Ochlocracy (\"rule of the general populace\") is democracy (\"rule of the people\") spoiled by demagoguery, \"tyranny of the majority\" and the rule of passion over reason, just like oligarchy (\"rule of a few\") is aristocracy (\"rule of the best\") spoiled by corruption, and tyranny is monarchy spoiled by lack of virtue. Ochlocracy is synonymous in meaning and usage to the modern, informal term \"Mobocracy,\" which emerged from a much more recent colloquial etymology. So my doubt is how to identify the symptoms of a decadent democracy that is converting slowly into a ochlocracy, and the signals of a real ochlocracy. Thanks!"
352,Can copyright be interpreted as a liberal economic policy?,NEGATIVE,"Note: This question refers to liberal as in Liberalism, not as in American Liberalism! As copyright is considered a state-guaranteed monopoly for the creators of works, could it be considered a true liberal economic policy? I'm not interested in debating pro and cons, if so, the question would be too much of an invitation for debate, I'm only interested in a scholarly analysis of copyright as either being or not being a liberal policy. I would understand if you would see the question as to open ended, if so, please comment on it and I'll amend the question to accommodate your concerns."
353,What is the difference between liberalism and libertarianism?,NEGATIVE,"According to wikipedia Liberalism (from the Latin liberalis) is a political philosophy or worldview founded on the idea of liberty and equality. Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but generally they support ideas such as free and fair elections, civil rights, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, free trade, and a right to life, liberty, and property. while Libertarianism is the group of political philosophies which advocate minimizing coercion and emphasize freedom, liberty, and voluntary association. Libertarians generally advocate a society with significantly less government compared to most present day societies. From these definitions it seems that liberalism has a stronger focus on equality, while libertarianism is strongly associated with small government. Can anybody describe the differences more accurately? Might it be that the term libertarianism got more widespread as the meaning of liberalism in the USA shifted leftwards?"
354,"",NEGATIVE,"I'm not sure what you mean in this context by decadent. However, a key difference is that democracy is more than majority rule. Ochlocracy is the rule by the majority. Democracy is much more. Definitions vary, but democracies have constitutions protecting citizens rights, civil liberties, rule of law, equality before the law, and other rights. Those rights cannot simply be voted away by a simple majority. In a well-functioning democracy, such rights are safeguarded. Quoting the Wikipedia article on democracy: While there is no universally accepted definition of \"democracy,\"[5] equality and freedom have both been identified as important characteristics of democracy since ancient times.[6] These principles are reflected in all all citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative, and the freedom of its all citizens is secured by legitimized rights and liberties which are generally protected by a constitution. In my interpretation, a democracy is degenerating into an ochlocracy if it takes away those properties of democracy other than majority rule. Precise examples are likely to be subjective. Some examples include: In Switzerland, a November 2009 referendum introduced a ban on minarets. This might be considered a degeneration into ochlocracy, because it is a majority rule in direct democracy taking away a particular right of a religious minority (to build houses of worship in their own preferred style). Some examples of articles exploring whether or not this is a degeneration into ochlocracy can be found here and here. According to this blog post (frankly a bit of a rant), the Patriot act is an example of what it calls mobocracy, because a parliamentary majority decides to take away what it describes as many fundamental rights. The same blog post describes as such the war against Iraq. I think it argues that the war against Iraq was authorised despite being illegal. On the other side of the political spectrum, popular nationalisation of foreign assets could probably be described as ochlocratic. I'll search for a source to back this up Perhaps any majority decision one disagrees with could be described as ochlocratic. For example, Conservapedia describes Wikipedia as ochlocratic, without explaining why. I'm sure there are many more examples that can be given across the political spectrum. I'll do an attempt to summarise the symptoms, based on my own interpretation of the examples abowe: Decisions by parliaments or referendums are taken as absolute and more important than the constitution, international treaties, or other fundamental laws. In political debate, one hears increasingly often arguments that boil down to the voter is always right. Minorities or arguments by experts are set aside in favour of the vox populi, the opinion of the man in the street. There are probably other aspects that I'm not thinking of right now. I don't have sources to back up the symptoms; the sources that I could find all relate to specific examples."
355,"",NEGATIVE,"Saddam wasn't worried in those days about the United States. He was worried about Iran. He actually manufactured evidence to make Iran believe they had WMDs. Among other things, Saddam claimed after his capture that he lied to his generals that he did have WMDs. (Source) One can assume that some of the proof the United States had was related to this."
356,What policies can reduce or prevent cost overruns on big infrastructure projects?,NEGATIVE,"Big infrastructure projects often lead to major cost overruns. For example: Betuweroute railway in The Netherlands, planned at 2.5 billion €, final costs 4.7 billion € Gotthard base tunnel, estimated at 8 billion Swiss francs, present estimate 12 billion Swiss francs Amsterdam Noord/Zuid-lijn, estimated at 300 million euro, present estimate 900 million euro What causes such big cost overruns (that are almost always associated with delays as well) and what can be done by decision-takers to prevent them?"
358,Why is West Virginia a state?,NEGATIVE,"First off, I am a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and am completely aware of the circumstances of the creation of the state of West Virginia. In 1863, in the midst of the Rebellion, Congress admitted those counties (mostly in the non-slaveholding, mountainous counties) as a state called 'West Virginia.' After the war, there was some kind of settlement that involved West Virginia owing Virginia a large sum of money that wasn't fully paid off until 1959. But today, I read through the constitution again, and found this: Clause 1: New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. So, Virginia clearly never gave its consent, and the State was formed out of Virginia. (Unlike Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, or Illinois, to which Virginia did give its assent.) How is it then, that the Congress was so blantantly able to disregard the Constitution? And is it possible to challenge it now?"
359,"",NEGATIVE,"There are three main reasons for such big cost overruns: People are generally sucky at estimates of time or money. I'm intimately familiar with that from software engineering project management side, but most of the issues aren't specific to programming. Anyone thinking X will take N days and M dollars should budget 3X days and 4X dollars. If you are trying to sell a large project politically (meaning, seem like you care about taxpayer money), citing realistic correct costs is a sure way to NOT have your project approved, since - as you can see from the example of Big Dig, the difference is usually \"this will get paid off in 3-5 years in benefits\" vs \"This will get paid off in 50 years, if at all\". This means that people are strongly incentivized to underestimate the costs dramatically and NOT try to get real ones. It's not THEIR money being spent, after all. For those who don't know: Big Dig in Boston was a humongous infrastructure project famous for overruns. \"The project was scheduled to be completed in 1998 at an estimated cost of $2.8 billion (in 1982 dollars, US$6.0 billion adjusted for inflation as of 2006). The project was not completed, however, until December 2007, at a cost of over $14.6 billion ($8.08 billion in 1982 dollars) as of 2006. The Boston Globe estimated that the project will ultimately cost $22 billion, including interest, and that it will not be paid off until 2038\". There ultimately seems to be no risk (politically and economically) for lying or making mistakes about cost estimates. I'm not aware of any politicians who suffered for approving such drastic errors - and you can be sure the companies who got awarded the huge contracts can take care of any politician who helped them in the unlikely case such a person doesn't get re-elected. Frankly, realistically NOTHING can be done about such issues, unless your ruler happens to be Emperor Leto II Atreides. Project Management as study discipline came up with several (or many) approaches to help, but ultimately the problems stem from human nature. The two solution approaches would be: Strong policies to dis-incentivise overruns, for both politicians (immediate ban from political activity for lobbying for a bad project, with actionable clawbacks in salary); and for contractors (again, bans on any further government contracts; fee clawbacks; and immediate termination of contract once overrun reaches certain threshold, with requirement to get another contractor to complete) Automatically apply \"project management inflation\" rule of thumb mentioned above (cost *4, duration *3) to any estimates not backed up by both rigorous details of why they are accurate AND a history of a given contractor giving good estimates. Have project checkpoints at frequent intervals, that serve to calibrate costs/deadlines. Any other Project Management techniques that work (I'm not a PMP but I play one at my day job)"
360,"",NEGATIVE,"First of all, as usual in politics, you got definition confusions galore. For one thing, what we call \"libertarianism\" in USA today was originally called \"classical liberalism\" - and AFAIK is still called that in Europe (don't tell any of the modern liberals in America who get allergic reaction from a mention of Mises or Ayn Rand :) If you mean \"modern American liberalism\", that has 2 other semantic problems: It is again a fairly vague term with wide variety of views inside. You got people from Dennis Kucinich to Weather Underground; from Charlie Wilson (\"Liberal from Lufkin\") to Nancy Pelosi. Some of the words of definitions are very political-viewpoint-specicfic (in other words, just because a liberal will tell you he stands for \"X\", doesn't mean he stands for \"X\" in reality, at least from the point of view of his political opponent. Same with when an anti-liberal telling you that liberals stand for \"Y\"). For example your Wiki definition mentioned \"freedom of the press\". That is extra double hard to square with modern American Liberals solidly supporting \"Fairness Doctrine\" in 2000s. Or state-supported arts. Or bailouts to floundering liberal newspapers like NYT. Or with strong political support for Hugo Chavez who closes down all opposition press. \"Free trade\" - tell that to Colombians who got shafted by union friendly Democrats from getting an already-negotiated Free Trade agreement approved. The one prominent Democrat who was strongly pro-free-trade (Bill Clinton) was definitely not on the \"liberal\" wing of DNC. \"a right to life, liberty, and property\" - as long as your right to life doesn't conflict with their political ideals; and your right to liberty as long as you don't do anything they disagree with - from \"thinking bad thoughts\" to \"acting with prejudice against protected minority, where liberals are the only judges whether you were doing so\", and your right to property as long as you aren't the demonized-right-now evil class (loggers, oil producers, people who use animals for testing products, evil \"bankers\", evil \"rich people\" etc...). Oh, and you have a right to property till liberals decide you make \"too much money\" and not enough of it is taken from you in taxes. Again, with THEM being the only judge of where \"too much\" is. Having said that, if you want to try for some generalizations, you may say that in USA, liberals are more for bigger government with more powers (tax, regulatory, social rules) and libertarians are for smaller governments with less powers (tax, regulatory, social rules). Also, American liberals don't mind using force and violence (in a civilized way) to get their ends (for example, using police power of the state to enforce their material redistribution problems, or personally intimidating people who donate money to causes they find morally repugnant), while most of modern libertarianism is built on philosophical and ethical foundation of NON-violence. Purely 100% libertarian society is based on fully voluntary contracts for 100% of things, and no coercion. To address the last item in your question: When you say \"focus on equality\", again, you run into definition issues. Liberals are focused on equality of outcome, at the cost of equality of opportunity (e.g. Affirmative Action, highly progressive taxation). Libertarians are committed to equality of opportunity (e.g. everyone gets to play by the same rules), while admitting that said approach will necessarily result in inequality of outcomes. Now, if you meant the difference between \"classical liberalism\" and libertarianism, that one is a lot more nuanced since they are much closer to each other. Short short version is that libertarianism is in some ways derived - or inherits from - classical libertarianism, throwing out the idea of Social Contract and more clearly defines the basis for individual rights and limits on governments. One of the posters at mises.org put the differences down as follows: Norman Barry has written a book on the different trends into the contemporary libertarian tradition, fittingly titled \"On classical liberalism and libertarianism\"; where he differentiates the two on the basis of the consequentialist (ie, economic or utilitarian) v. deontological (normative) foundation of the respective theories. He does, however, concedes that he is using this classification as a short-hand in the absence of a more sophisticated treatment of the dividing line.' In plain/street english, libertarianism is seen as an extreme/radical variant of classical liberalism, somewhere between liberalism and anarchism... just taking the liberal concepts further and accepting their logical consequences. A good resource for comparison is an article \"Classical Liberalism, Libertarianism, and Individualism\" by Jonathan Dolhenty, Ph.D. (archive.org link). Here are relevant exerpts, though I recommend reading the whole thing: First of all, on Classical Liberalism and Libertarianism: It seems to be clear that Libertarianism developed from Classical Liberalism. Its modern form developed in the United States, where it drew on rights theory, free-market economics, the romantic individualist ideas set out in works such as those of Ayn Rand, for instance, and the American tradition of non-interventionism in foreign policy. The Vietnam War, and resistance to conscription during that time, and the socio-political attitudes arising from the turmoil of the 1960s seem to have resulted in a loose movement that included a variety of different people, conservatives and liberals, who held the common view that people ought to make decisions for themselves and not force their decisions on others. A division eventually developed between those Libertarians who wanted to get rid of the state or government altogether and those who were uneasy about the state, but thought that it should be severely limited. The former group are called the Anarco-Capitalist Libertarians, while the latter group are called either just Libertarians or, like myself, Moderate Libertarians. There may be, of course, other interpretations of Libertarianism that I don't know about, and they may place another modifier in front of the term \"Libertarian.\" Also, I don't think there are significant foundational differences between Moderate Libertarians and Classical Liberals, although disagreements between the two may arise when it comes to some specific practical policies such as defense, capital punishment, law and order, and so forth, and the role of a government in these matters. He also wrote on differences between Classical Liberals and Welfare Liberals, which I discussed in the first half of the answer: Classical Liberals, like myself, stress such ideas as voluntary association, incentives, and self-interest. We believe that people are bound by their own decisions, agreements, contracts, and so on. Therefore, people may do unpleasant jobs, for instance, because they pay. They may, of course, do things as well for non-financial reasons. It is important to note that we stress that our way of doing things combines a way to get things done with a high degree of individual freedom. We assume that people recognize the rights of others and some uncontracted obligations toward others, as well. Classical Liberalism can be contrasted with Welfare or Modern Liberalism which has an opposing view and is currently the dominant political philosophy in the United States. Welfare Liberals think that citizens should have far more welfare guarantees; indeed, some have suggested that everyone should have a guaranteed income. For example, two Yale Law School professors, Bruce Ackermann and Ann Alstott, have advocated that every U.S. citizen with a high school diploma should receive a bounty of $80,000 on his or her twenty-first birthday. Welfare Liberals tend to favor paternalistic actions by government to protect people, and they are less worried about the ethics and practicalities of social engineering by government. They give more weight to social obligations, instead of basic rights, and when they talk about rights and obligations, they have in mind the idea that those who are fortunate have an obligation to serve the community as a whole. ..So we can say in a general way that one approach, Classical Liberalism, favors incentives, the shaping of the individual through family upbringing, and participation in the ordinary institutions of a commercial society. The other side, Welfare or Modern Liberals, puts greater weight on socialization to predispose people to specific views and perspectives which favor their agenda. Welfare Liberalism, by the way, does have a real problem with how to get individuals to do things since there is little incentive to do constructive things if you are given what you need by the government rather than having to work for it yourself. One might note that welfare recipients have little incentive to take really unpleasant jobs."
361,"",NEGATIVE,"The word \"libertarianism\" was essentially invented because classical liberals felt that the word had become expropriated. Leonard E. Reed wrote in Castles in the Air: There was a word that I always liked; the classical economists used it: liberal. The word liberal really meant, in the classical sense, the liberalization of the individuals from the tyranny of the State. That word was expropriated by our opponents and it has now come to mean liberality with other people’s money. The word was taken over. And so I, more than anybody else, was responsible for introducing and publicizing and perhaps making world-wide the word libertarian. . ."
362,Did the Socialist and the Fascist party share the electoral programme in Italy?,NEGATIVE,"I was taught that in the early twenties the Socialist and the Fascist parties programmes were more or less identical, except for just one nationalist clause in the Fascist party's programme. Despite those parties being rivals, it actually made sense, since the Fascist party was born out of Social origins; strangely, though, I wasn't able to find those programmes. Did such a thing really happen, or was I mis-taught?"
363,"",NEGATIVE,"Based on comments above, Abraham Lincoln wrestled with this same question. In summary, he basically said that the Legislature of Virginia - at least those souls left in the state - did give their assent. The full text of his opinion (see @ymar's link) is below. The key part of his argument is: A body claiming to be such Legislature has given its consent. We can not well deny that it is such, unless we do so upon the outside knowledge that the body was chosen at elections, in which a majority of the qualified voters of Virginia did not participate. In other words: Most of Virginia left, so there was a vacancy in Richmond The vote held in Charleston was to be recognized as the state of Virginia. People who don't vote don't count. (That last bit is a good argument for the bumper stickers that say, 'I don't care what you think if you didn't vote!) This still should be understood to be the opinion of the executive, not the Supreme Court, but it at least provides the rationale. I can't imagine the Supreme Court now overturning this logic. THE CONSENT of the Legislature of Virginia is constitutionally necessary to the bill for the admission of West Virginia becoming a law. A body claiming to be such Legislature has given its consent. We can not well deny that it is such, unless we do so upon the outside knowledge that the body was chosen at elections, in which a majority of the qualified voters of Virginia did not participate. But it is a universal practice in the popular elections in all these States to give no legal consideration whatever to those who do not choose to vote, as against the effect of the votes of those who do choose to vote. Hence it is not the qualified voters, but the qualified voters, who choose to vote, that constitute the political power of the State. Much less than to non-voters, should any consideration be given to those who did not vote, in this case: because it is also a matter of outside knowledge, that they were not merely neglectful of their rights under, and duty to, this government, but were also engaged in open rebellion against it. Doubtless among these non-voters were some Union men whose voices were smothered by the more numerous secessionists; but we know too little of their number to assign them any appreciable value. Can the government stand, if it indulges Constitutional constructions by which men in open rebellion against it, are to be accounted, man for man, the equals of those who maintain their loyalty to it? Are they to be accounted even better citizens, and more worthy of consideration, than those who merely neglect to vote? If so, their treason against the Constitution, enhances their constitutional value! Without braving these absurd conclusions, we cannot deny that the body which consents to the admission of West Virginia, is the Legislature of Virginia. I do not think the plural form of the words 'Legislatures' and 'States' in the phrase of the Constitution 'without the consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned' has any reference to the new State concerned. That plural form sprang from the contemplation of two or more old States, contributing to form a new one. The idea that the new state was in danger of being admitted without its own consent, was not provided against, because it was not thought of, as I conceive. It is said, the devil takes care of his own. Much more should a good spirit - the spirit of the Constitution and the Union - take care of its own. I think it can not do less, and live. But is the admission into the Union, of West Virginia, expedient. This, in my general view, is more a question for Congress, than for the Executive. Still I do not evade it. More than on any thing else, it depends on whether the admission or rejection of the new State would, under all the circumstances tend the more strongly to the restoration of the National authority throughout the Union. That which helps most in this direction is most expedient at this time. Doubtless those in remaining Virginia would return to the Union, so to speak, less reluctantly without the division of the old state than with it; but I think we could not save as much in this quarter by rejecting the new state, as we should lose by it in West Virginia. We can scarcely dispense with the aid of West Virginia in this struggle; much less can we afford to have her against us, in Congress and in the field. Her brave and good men regard her admission into the Union as a matter of life and death. They have been true to the Union under very severe trials. We have so acted as to justify their hopes; and we can not fully retain their confidence, and co-operation, if we seem to break faith with them. In fact, they could not do so much for us, if they would. Again, the admission of the new State turns that much slave soil to free; and thus, is a certain, and irrevocable encroachment upon the cause of the rebellion, The division of a State is dreaded as a precedent. But a measure made expedient by a war, is no precedent for times of peace. It is said the admission of West Virginia is secession, and tolerated only because it is our secession. Well, if we can call it by that name, there is still difference enough between secession against the Constitution, and secession in favor of the Constitution. I believe the admission of West Virginia into the Union is expedient. - Abraham Lincoln, December 31, 1862, Lincoln Papers, Library of Congress."
364,Is there an optimal size of a parliament?,NEGATIVE,Are there any studies that have been done correlating size of the electorate (or in general the population) to size of parliament and stability criteria? I was wondering which size of a parliament is scientifically deemed adequate. I could not find any data on votes required per seat in national parliaments in relation to how well they are accepted and how stable they are. Does anybody have data to give at least a ball-park number on how many voters should be represented by one member of parliament?
365,"How does DOMA get around the \"Full Faith and Credit\" clause to the Constitution?",NEGATIVE,"Regardless of what one feels about \"gay marriage\", the recent decision by the Supreme Court to review the case brings up an interesting Constitutional question. Namely, if, say, Maryland recognizes the union of two homosexual individuals as a \"marriage,\" what is Virginia's obligation to treat those two individuals as a married couple? Obviously, the Supreme Court has to get involved, because two states have differing and mutually exclusive interpretations (Virginia explicitly disallows it, Maryland explicitly allows it), but the \"Full Faith and Credit Clause\" obliges reciprocity. The question I have, then, is about the \"Defense of Marriage Act\" which was somehow able to get around Artice IV. My understanding is that DOMA explicitly allowed individual states to decide for themselves (ala the Tiebout Model) but didn't force states to be reciporical. What was the legal justification for this?"
366,"",NEGATIVE,Congress does not have to currently justify the laws it passes. The checks and balance system works so that Legislature must pass a law in both sides of the Congress. Then the President must sign it or Congress can override a veto with 2/3 vote. Then the law can be challenged in court. How ever to challenge the law's constitutionality you have to first have standing to bring a case. It is generally not enough to show that you may be wronged in the future but rather you have to show that you have been wronged. In this specific case you would either have to be a married gay couple from Maryland that had some right that exists for married people in Virginia denied to you to have cause to bring a case. Further it would need to be denied based upon the DOMA. If it is denied based upon existing Virginia law that is not cause to overturn the DOMA. The state of Maryland is having its rights to decide what it will define as a marriage infringed. So the state of Maryland could have cause to bring a case against the United States. All you need would need to do is convince the State of Maryland to fight in court to affirm its state's rights. I suspect you have better odds of getting Gay Marriage passed in Texas (and getting them to pursue the case) than getting Maryland to fight for states rights since the precedent it would set would be used by other states against other laws(like Obamacare). In this case Maryland sits on its hands(metaphorically) to preserve the Federal Governments Rights to curtail states rights.
367,Does Mcullough v. Maryland mean that charitable donations cannot be taxed?,NEGATIVE,"In McCulough v. Maryland, Chief Justice John Marshall promulgated the doctrine the power to tax is the power to destroy. Additionally, as we all know, the Lemon Test prohibits the United States government from enacting laws that \"have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion.\" Given these two points, is it fair to say that any proposal to eliminate the charitable contributions deduction would, by putting taxes on religious institutions, be considered unconstiutional?"
368,What special regulations make Freetown Christiania autonomous?,NEGATIVE,"Freetown Christiania is a self-proclaimed autonomous neighbourhood in Copenhagen. Picture from Wikimedia Commons, Bruno Jargot Christiania is an anarchist, autonomous community. According to Wikipedia, the area has a unique status in that it is regulated by a special law, the Christiania Law of 1989 which transfers parts of the supervision of the area from the municipality of Copenhagen to the state. Many of the living rules, such as building permits, are decided by consensus in a general assembly of residents. The residents of Christiania do not live independent of the Danish state: they pay taxes, their children go to recognised schools, and if there is a fire, they do allow the fire brigade to enter the area, and residents are not necessarily opposed to the existance of the state (though the reverse of the sign in the picture reads You are now entering the EU). In practice, what makes Christania special? What is the relation between Christania and the Danish government, local or national? What are the powers that have been granted to the community? How far does its independence go? I'm looking for answers that summarise the special status of Christiania in a political-legal context, not so much in the culture of the residents. Christiania seems quite unique — but why?"
370,How are conflicts between constitutional and treaty obligations resolved?,VERY_NEGATIVE,"The present Constitution of Bolivia, which came into effect on the 7th of February 2009, has this to say about coca (an English translation follows the original Spanish): Artículo 384. El Estado protege a la coca originaria y ancestral como patrimonio cultural, recurso natural renovable de la biodiversidad de Bolivia, y como factor de cohesión social; en su estado natural no es estupefaciente. La revalorización, producción, comercialización e industrialización se regirá mediante la ley.1 Article 384. The State shall protect native and ancestral coca as a cultural patrimony, a renewable natural resource of the biodiversity of Bolivia, and a factor of social cohesion; in its natural state it is not a narcotic. Its revaluation, production, commercialization and industrialization shall be regulated by law. Between the 23rd of September 1976 and the 1st of January 2012 (when it was officially denounced by the Bolivian government), Bolivia was a signatory to the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which states: Article 26, paragraph 2. The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated.2 and Article 49, paragraph 2(e). Coca leaf chewing must be abolished within twenty-five years from the coming into force of this Convention as provided in paragraph 1 of Article 41. On their face, these constitutional and treaty obligations, which were simultaneously in force through most of 2009-2011, would appear to have been in direct conflict. This apparent conflict was eventually resolved (after repeated attempts to amend the Convention by Bolivian governments throughout the time Bolivia was a signatory) by Bolivia's denunciation of the Convention, as noted above. I understand that some international treaties, however, are considered irrevocable - for instance, I've read that there is no legal mechanism by which a member state can leave the European Union - and conversely, constitutional amendments often require ratification by referendum, which obviously is not guaranteed to succeed. In such a case, how is the conflict resolved? I'm interested here in both the theoretical (which obligation is considered to have precedence) and the practical (what is likely to actually happen). On a side note, I'd also be interested to hear about other states which confer (or have conferred) protected or otherwise special status on particular substances, plants or animals. UPDATE: Bolivia has now reacceded to the Convention, with the reservation that it \"reserves the right to allow in its territory: traditional coca leaf chewing; the consumption and use of the coca leaf in its natural state for cultural and medicinal purposes; its use in infusions; and also the cultivation, trade and possession of the coca leaf to the extent necessary for these licit purposes.\"3 References: Constitutión Política del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia (PDF) Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (PDF) Associated Press, 11 January 2013 Note: the linked PDF for reference #2 is a very poor scan of a paper document.

371,"",NEGATIVE,"Typically a sovereign nations constitution represents the highest law of the land, as it defines the framework for all other laws that that come after it. Using the United States as an example then it becomes clear what would occur in this situation for the United States as it clearly declares that a Treaty is to be a \"Law of the Land\" This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. For the United States however the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and supersedes everything else, meaning that if such a Treaty were ratified that it directly violated the Constitution then it would be invalid and could be challenged in the Supreme Court. International Law however disagrees. A Treaty is the highest form of law between two countries and is binding between two states as a contract (barring the treaty doesn't violate any other International Laws and that the Treaty was passed valid per the states rules on ratification of Treaties). This applies to all 112 countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/summaries/1_1.htm Again however, this International Law on treaties is meaningless to the United States as it had only signed the Law of Treaties but did not in fact ratify it per our Constitution. This essentially means that the United States deems itself perfectly legal to enter into, leave or break treaties of its own will regardless of International Law. This also happens to be the case for Bolivia (Dark green are countries that Ratified the Treaty of Laws, Light Green are Signatories)! Interestingly enough I think the case can be made that the Treaty is completely invalid for Bolivia. Bolivia did not ratify the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties so they are not legally bound to it by International Law. Even if it had been a ratifying state, it is still invalid because the Bolivian government was wrong to ratify it according to Article 27, Vienna Convention on the Law of treaties. A party's consent to a treaty is invalid if it had been given by an agent or body without power to do so under that state's domestic law. IANAL, but I think a strong case can be made that in this specific case that the Bolivian Treaty is invalid. How this can be resolved is dependent on how the Constitution of that country specifies potentially invalid laws are to be challenged. Typically this would be through a Higher Court of some kind."
372,"",NEGATIVE,"Removing the tax deduction for charitable contributions would not put a tax on religious institutions, meaning that regardless of the validity of your Lemon Test + McCulloch analysis, there would be no constitutional issue. The tax deduction reduces the amount of taxes the person donating to the religious institution pays. That is, when you donate to the religious institution, you pay less taxes as a result. If we removed the tax deduction, you would pay higher taxes, not the religious institution."
374,"",NEGATIVE,"Since March 2004, when a massive police raid took place in Christiania, the community has been under constant police surveillance, with regular patrols. The raid, and the blurry status of Christiania in general lead to an amendment in the Christiania Law of 1989 in 2004, Act No. 431: This was adopted on 1 June 2004 and came into force on 15 June 2004. The purpose of the Act is to lay down the framework for a new development of the Christiania area, which accommodates an alternative social structure in accordance, however, with the general rules of Danish law. The Palaces and Properties Agency has been carrying out this work since then. A series of negotiations between the Danish government and Christiania's residents started with Act No. 431 and ended with the residents rejecting the government's proposals in June 2008. A new series of negotiations started in September 2008, this time based around proposals initiated by Christiania's residents. This second series of negotiations reached a conclusion in June 2011, when Christiania accepted a deal that would both legitimise the community and allow its residents to preserve their lifestyle. The Christianianites would have to pay 120 million kroner to buy the property they occupy and Knud Foldshack, the lawyer representing Christiania, has compared Christiania's future legal status to that of a council: “It’s basically the creation of a new council in Copenhagen. There are actually council in Denmark which are smaller. It has been a super interesting task, but also the hardest case I have ever been involved in,” Foldschack said. The first instalment payment (51.8 million kroner) was successfully made on July 1, 2012, and Christiania is en route to moving on from the semi-legal status it held since 1989 to a special, but fully legal, status of collective ownership.

375,"Who first proposed the idea that \"Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses\"?",NEGATIVE,"King Arthur: The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Dennis: Listen. Strange women lying in ponds, distributing swords, is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony! (\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", naturally). Who was the first political thinker (ruler, or civil servant, or theorist or writer/philosopher) who proposed this rule about mandate from the governed masses? Any wording is acceptable as long as the spirit matches. Just to be clear, the idea being referred to can be summarized as: You can not stably rule a set of people who fully disagree with the idea of your ruling them. You can only rule them when they - for whatever reasons - acquiesce to, if not support - your rule. NOTE: The question is specifically limited to the rule being framed as a rule. To be more precise, stated in the form of \"every government should have a mandate of the masses\", as opposed to \"well, I think such a mandate is a swell idea for my specific city government, but I won't formally postulate that without such, no other government can work\"."
376,India - States and Union Territories,NEGATIVE,"India has 28 States, and seven Union Territories. While States have their own elected Governments, Union Territories are directly controlled by the federal government. What was the purpose of creating two different types of administrative division? Why are the Union Territories not, instead, States?"
377,"",NEGATIVE,"Epicureanism Is probably the earliest example you will find of the concept you refer to, which is normally called the social contract - basically that the governed have agreed to give up some of their power and freedom in exchange for the security and benefits of living in a larger society with laws and systems of governance. In Epicurus' Principal Doctrines there are a few lines (this is from the wikipedia page on social contracts linked above): Natural justice is a pledge of reciprocal benefit, to prevent one man from harming or being harmed by another. Those animals which are incapable of making binding agreements with one another not to inflict nor suffer harm are without either justice or injustice; and likewise for those peoples who either could not or would not form binding agreements not to inflict nor suffer harm. There never was such a thing as absolute justice, but only agreements made in mutual dealings among men in whatever places at various times providing against the infliction or suffering of harm. While the wording isn't exactly what you are after, the philosophy is the same - in order to get the benefits of a system of justice, men (people) agree to concessions."
378,"",NEGATIVE,"In John Locke's Second Treatise on Government Chapter 11, Section 134 (written in 1690), he writes: The lawful power of making laws to command whole politic societies of men, belonging so properly unto the same intire societies, that for any prince or potentate of what kind soever upon earth, to exercise the same of himself, and not by express commission immediately and personally received from God, or else by authority derived at the first from their consent, upon whose persons they impose laws, it is no better than mere tyranny. Laws they are not therefore which public approbation hath not made so. Hooker's Eccl. Pol. l. i. sect. 10. Of this point therefore we are to note, that sith [sic - should be such] men naturally have no full and perfect power to command whole politic multitudes of men, therefore utterly without our consent, we could in such sort be at no man's commandment living. And to be commanded we do consent, when that society, whereof we be a part, hath at any time before consented, without revoking the same after by the like universal agreement. Laws therefore human, of what kind so ever, are available by consent. Ibid While others may have made the argument earlier, he is often credited with at least popularizing the idea that 'power is derived from the consent of the governed,' and was often cited by the Founding Fathers as the impetus for this idea. Social Contract Theory as a whole often traces its roots through Hobbes' 'state of Nature,' (in which, in the absence of a despot to bring order, life was nasty, brutish and short, and as such people would choose a Leviathan - a monarch to beat the stuffing out of them in order to persuade people to adhere to the rules they wanted) and developed throughout the late Enlightenment. Locke extended this idea into government as a 'contract' in which people give up autonomy in order to perserve life, liberty, and wealth. This 'deal' gives institutions power in order to further individual ends. Hobbes, Locke, Rosseau, and others are often considered its progenitors, and John Stuart Mill often seen as its flower."
379,"",NEGATIVE,"Government contracts typically fall into two primary categories: Fixed Price Contracts Time and Materials Contracts As one can deduce from the names, a fixed price contract is just that - the vendor is given a certain amount of money, and and imposes fines and penalties if the desired bridge, software, space ship, whatever isn't delivered on time. The company that accepts this bet believes that it can deliver the good or service, plus a reasonable profit, for the fixed amount. Since the government's procurement policies often require acceptance of the lowest bid that it believes has a reasonable chance of successfully executing the project, it follows that this optimizes the tradeoff between risk and price. The downside, of course, is that for unknown costs, many vendors are unwilling to to strictly abide by a fixed fee contract, and instead wish the ultimate risk to be borne by the customer, hence the \"time and materials\" form of contract. In order to entice vendors to take such a risk, they must either agree to reduce the risk or extend the profit. As such, even a fixed fee contract may not arrive at the lowest price but technically will arrive at the lowest cost, since other factors (including risk) are part of the cost even if they are not part of the price. By definition, however, a fixed fee contract pushes the entire burden of a cost overrun onto the vendor. In exchange for this risk, a fixed fee contract will most likely entail a higher price than doing it ones'self. Hybrids exist in which a fixed fee is guaranteed, but a certain amount of the risk is mitigated by a T&amp;M contract."
380,"What is the origin of the Durand Line, and what is the liklihood that it will persist over time?",NEGATIVE,"My understanding of Pakistani and Afghanistani politics is that the border between these two countries is ill-defined, porous, and mostly a figment of British imagination moreso than any reality on the ground. The tribal areas such as the Swat Valley where Al-Qaeda held sway seem to be far more lawless than Pakistan in general, and a very \"dangerous\" area in particular. So, how is then that this area became part of British India in the first place, and what are Pakistan's prospects of being able to incorporate these lawless areas into its mainstream altogether? Also, I have heard that Afghanistan does not recognize Pakistan's claim to the Tribal areas demarcated by the Durand, and that if Afghanistan could ever become a fully functioning state, would lay claim to some Pakistan's territory. Is there any truth to this understanding?"
381,Can the Equal Rights Amendment still be ratified?,NEGATIVE,"Given that it took the 27th Amendment to the United States Constitution over 200 years to be ratified, would the Equal Rights Amendment that is currently three states short of the required 38 states need to start the entire process over again given that the deadline written into the initial law has been exceeded? Obviously, the proposed amendment would need amended again to be passed, but since Congress did extend the deadline once, could they not do that again? As Congress has the power to administer the ratification process in the Constitution, it seems to me like anything Congress says would go. Is the 3 state strategy constitutionally viable?"
382,"",NEGATIVE,"DOMA as a congressional statute could not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution. Rather the mandate of the Full Faith and Credit Clause is on the states and their actions in response to DOMA. Just because DOMA allows states to define marriage on their own terms, does not create a conflict so long as, for example, Texas affords the same state rights to a married gay couple from Iowa while that couple is in their state as they would otherwise have afforded a straight married couple from Iowa. Whats more, have already seen that play out in the courts. In 2009 a legally married gay couple from Massachusetts was given a divorce by a Texas judge, even though Texas law does not recognize the marriage. The Texas judge gave full faith to the Massachusetts marriage license and applied Texas divorce law as appropriate. This legal action, not the text of DOMA itself, is what could potentially run aground of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Congress also allows states to issue their own drivers licenses and set the standards for obtaining said license. It is entirely possible that a legal Ohio driver would fail a driving test in North Carolina due to ignorance of the differences in traffic laws between the two states. However, North Carolina does not test every Ohio driver pulled over in North Carolina for speeding, because they give Full Faith and Credit to that state's license. It is not unconstitutional for Congress to allow states to set up their own license requirements, but it would be unconstitutional for the North Carolina in this example to take action under that law to discriminate against Ohio drivers."
383,Does an increase in education cause an increase in the probability of voting?,NEGATIVE,I came across the following claim during a discussion: An increase in education causes an increase in the probability of voting. So I was interested whether there is any proof or research supporting the statement. Intuitively I would agree but given that intuition and politics seldom look good together I would want proof to verify or reject the statement.
384,What factors influence the number of political parties?,NEGATIVE,"While I know that the question could disintegrate into a list of things type of question I would really see answers that respect the back-it-up-rule and which would go deeper than only listing factors. Now the question: What factors influence the number of political parties? I'm interested into which factors have been scientifically proven to influence the number of political parties in a geographical area. Additionally and to make the question narrower, I would like to see explanations as to why these factors influence the number of political parties."
385,"",NEGATIVE,"Unlike the ERA and most modern amendments, when the 27th was proposed (one of the original 12 in the Bill of Rights) and sent to the states, there was no ratification period specified. The ERA, on the other hand, was given 7 years from the time it was sent to the states. As such, Congress could, if it chose, resubmit the amendment to the states, but it would start back at zero, and would need 38 states to ratify it in order to become valid. Were Congress to amend the bill sent to the states for ratification, extending the deadline after it passed, it is likely that someone would claim the law was passed ex post facto, something prohibited by the Constitution itself."
386,"",NEGATIVE,"Yes, there were a whole bunch of studies all of which point to education level as having very high predictive power (with positive correlation) as far as voter turnout, probably the highest exogenous predictive factor they found. I won't list all the studies, but will point to a paper that DOES list a bunch of them: \"The Dynamic Effects of Education on Voter Turnout\" (2009) by Barry C. Burden if University of Wisconsin. As a side note, if you want to find tons of studies on the topic, google for the ones that cite Brody's paper discussed below. As a side note, in American politics, there is a very interesting conundrum, which leads to your question's answer to both \"yes\" and \"no\", called \"Brody's puzzle\". It's named after a research by Brody in 1978 [Brody, R.A. (1978) \"The puzzle of political participation in America\"], which found that while education predicts whether individuals will vote, over time rising levels of education did not increase aggregate turnout. The paper linked above tries to research the topic."
387,Are single-member legislative districts a guarantee for two party systems?,NEGATIVE,Given that all countries that rely on a two-party system seem to have single-member legislative districts. I was wondering whether this in essence guarantees two party systems or whether this statement would not hold true. This should not be considered a duplicate to What factors influence the number of political parties? because this asks which factors influence the number in general while this is very specific whether a given factor guarantees a certain result.
388,"Has \"none of the above\" ever been added to a ballot? What was the effect?",NEGATIVE,"Besides Nevada having the option to vote none of the above (NOTA) are there any other places in the world which allow for voters to tick NOTA? If this is the case, are there any studies on the effect of having such an option? Does it increase voter turnout?"
389,How is the European integration process similar to the creation of the United States?,NEUTRAL,"What are the similarities and what are the major differences (economically, socially and culturally) between the current European integration process and the historical formation of the United States? Is the evolution from loose federation to a country in America a good indicator for future developments in Europe?"
390,"",NEGATIVE,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above has some examples: Greece (λευκό, white, but unrelated to a political party of the similarly sounding name-however it is symbolic only), the U.S. state of Nevada (None of These Candidates), Ukraine (Проти всіх), Spain (voto en blanco), and Colombia (voto en blanco). Russia had such an option on its ballots (Против всех) until it was abolished in 2006. Bangladesh introduced this option (না ভোট) in 2008."
391,"",NEGATIVE,"The main factor that determines the number of parties is the voting system. As for research supporting the claim I will cite this paper, which says: One of Duverger's most famous claims is that, in a law-like relationship, the plurality rule favors a two-party system while proportional systems lead to multipartyism (Duverger 1955). This raises the question of what is to ‘count’ as a party, in particular how to count very small parties. In recent years Lijphart (1994) reexamined the evidence for this thesis. The study compared 27 advanced industrialized democracies in 1945-90 based on the Laakso and Taagepera measure of the 'effective number of parliamentary parties' (ENPP), which takes account not only of the number of parties but also the relative size of each. Lijphart found that the ENPP was 2.0 in plurality systems, 2.8 in majority and 3.6 in proportional systems. Within proportional systems he found that the minimum threshold of votes also has an effect on the inclusion of minor parties. This other paper mentions it along with electoral volatility: The number of parties that compete for elections has been found to be positively associated with electoral volatility (Pedersen, 1979; Crewe, 1985; Bartolini and Mair, 1990), and it is well known that the electoral system is one of the main determinants of the number of parties that compete in elections (e.g. Rae, 1971; Taagepera and Shugart, 1989; Cox, 1997). The reason why systems like first-past-the-post tend to produce two party systems is quite obvious. If in each district seats are assigned only to the party with the highest number of votes it becomes a lot harder for smaller parties to obtain any seats at all. The only exception are regional parties that are strong in a certain region. Edit: fixed typos"
392,"",NEGATIVE,"It is easy to see that in theory there is no such guarantee (unless there are only two districts), as there is nothing to strictly prevent a different party winning in each district. Thus the theoretical maximum number of parties is given my the number of districts. Of course in practice it is very unlikely that there will be more than two or three big parties. The UK however is proof of the fact that even in practice a third party (in this case the Liberal Party) can become quite influential. This doesn't necessarily mean that it would be as easy in the USA, as there are quite a few differences, to name one: in the USA a party would need to win whole states if it wants to be able to win any seats. For seats won by third parties in the US see the list of third party performances on wikipedia."
393,"",NEGATIVE,"In a \"first-past-the-post\" system, it is difficult to sustain more than two parties. In any given district, candidates are either in power, in opposition (and working towards becoming the party in power), or are \"martyrs,\" meaning that they realize the have little chance of gaining majority status, but trudge on because of the \"rightness\" of their belief. This absolute assurance tends to be rather polarizing in practice, making it difficult to gain majority status. That said, the tendency is not absolute. Bernie Sanders, a Socialist, has for years represented Vermont. It is just that the situation is biased towards two parties."
394,"",NEGATIVE,"Political Differences: All the states of the United States have a common or very similar politician system where they elect the state-head of United States, the speakers for the congress, the governor, mayor and the member of district council, and others. The Unites States Army is under the control of the president of United States, so there is only one army for the whole nation and not one by State. The inner political system differs between the members of the European Union, some are Constitutional Monarchies, others are Presidential Republics, others are Parliamentary Republics, but in all the members the governors or (province administrators) are elected by people. The Europeans Union members have their own Army which are under the control of the state-head or prime minister is some cases, so the European Union doesn't have only one army. Economic Differences and Similarities: The United States economic activities are diverse, but there is a pattern, some States produce food, and others are more directed to the Industrial activities and Service. The Economic Geography in the European Union isn't uniform as we have seen since 2007 ~ 2008 with the economical crisis, most of economist use to say that the north of the EU is highly industrial developed with many High Technology Design Industries and Manufacture Industries, but the South is more directed to the Agriculture, Industrial Production of food, Tourism and other Services. Cultural Differences: All the states of United States of America have the same language. The languages of the European Union are very diverse, Spanish, English, French, Italian, Greek, and others. Religious Differences: There are several religions in United States, protestantism, evangelism, catholicism, and others, but they are very homogeneous distributed along all in United States ( I mean you can't say all Maryland's citizens are Christians but Massachusetts's citizens are all catholic, the difference isn't so high ). The religions in the Europe Union's members aren't so uniformly distributed, which increases the cultural differences between the Union members ( For example Spanish, Italian, Austrian, Belgium and Portuguese citizens are mostly catholic, but Germans, Dutches are protestant )."
395,"",NEGATIVE,"I base this answer on a mixture of common sense and this publication by Human Rights Watch. One of the most obvious factors impacting the number of political parties for an area is political repression by the incumbent government, such as in Zimbabwe: ZANU-PF has used the police and other state agencies to arbitrarily arrest and 'disappear' more than 40 MDC members and human rights activists. (An enforced disappearance is detention by authorities who refuse to acknowledge that they are holding the person or to reveal the person's fate or whereabouts, placing that person outside the protection of the law, and is a serious violation of international law. See International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, G.A. res. 61/177, U.N. Doc. A/RES/61/177 (2006), adopted Dec. 20, 2006.) It is not outside common sense reasoning that an area which has considerable political repression such as arrest, intimidation and/or assassination of members of opposing political parties, or the incumbent government making an opposition party illegal, would through fear result in fewer opposition parties being formed."
396,What are frequently heard arguments in favour or against term limits?,NEGATIVE,"Around the world, many presidents have term limits. For example, a United States president cannot serve more than eight years. On the other hand, it seems prime ministers and their cabinets usually don't have term limits, even if it's them that are in power in many countries, in particular in constitutional monarchies that are common in northern Europe. What are the advantages and disadvantages of term limits? Wouldn't it be more democratic if people could vote for whom they want? And all those countries without term limits — Netherlands, Sweden, Norway... — what negative consequences do they experience? Are term limits really necessary?"
397,"",NEGATIVE,"The United States is a constitutional republic in which the president, congress, and the judicial-branch share powers reserved to the national government according to its constitution. At the same time, it is a federal representative democracy consisting of 50 individual states, each with their own semi-autonomous government. The executive branch is headed by the President and is formally independent of both the legislature and the judiciary. The cabinet serves as a set of advisers to the President. They include the Vice President and heads of the executive departments. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The judicial branch (or judiciary), composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, exercises judicial power (or judiciary). The judiciary's function is to interpret the United States Constitution and federal laws and regulations. This includes resolving disputes between the executive and legislative branches. The federal government's layout is explained in the Constitution. Two political parties, the democratic-party and the republican-party, have dominated American politics since the American Civil War, although there are also smaller parties like the Libertarian Party, the Green Party, and the Constitution Party. There are major differences between the political system of the United States and that of most other developed democracies. These include greater power in the upper house of the legislature, a wider scope of power held by the Supreme Court, the separation of powers between the legislature and the executive, and the dominance of only two main parties. Third parties have less political influence in the United States than in other developed country democracies; this is because of a combination of stringent historic controls. These controls take shape in the form of state and federal laws, informal media prohibitions, and winner-take-all elections, and include ballot access issues and exclusive debate rules. This multiplicity of jurisdictions reflects the country's history. The federal government was created by the states, which as colonies were established separately and governed themselves independently of the others. Units of local government were created by the colonies to efficiently carry out various state functions. As the country expanded, it admitted new states modeled on the existing ones.

398,"",NEUTRAL,Questions relating to the government or the politics of the United States of America
399,"",NEUTRAL,"Democracy is a form of government literally meaning by the people, but existing in a wide variety of forms, such as direct democracy or parliamentary democracy. For more information, see Wikipedia."
400,"",NEGATIVE,"For questions about democracy, a system of government in many countries involving citizens voting, as opposed to dictatorships and other forms of government such as republicanism, where the people only have indirect authority through the ceding of power to elected representatives."
401,"",NEGATIVE,"While by no means an exclusive list, the pros and cons of term limits are: Pros: In some countries/locales, it is all but impossible to get rid of an incumbent politician, especially in parliament. This is extra problematic in US, where all that seems to be required to be re-elected is to have (1) a (frequently gerrymandered) district with 55%-65% in favor of your party; (2) bring home some pork (e.g. non-essential spending that you lobbied for the government to spend in your district); and (3) Not be \"caught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy\" (e.g. not to commit major political suicide, like sending your naked private parts to random women while married). In other words, no matter how poor a politician is, especially for the country as a whole, in USA it's rather easy for him/her to get re-elected. In USA, re-election rate is 80-90%, ALWAYS (except for Senate in late 70s). (source: http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/reelect.php ) . Now, contrast that chart with Congressional approval rating: Low of 10% in 2012; average well below 40%. Everyone hates Congress, but keeps re-electing their own congresscritter. Another proposed benefit (I'm not aware of how true it is) is that theoretically, a \"lame-duck\" politician (e.g. one NOT running for re-election) will be ready to make wiser decisions more beneficial to the whole country in a long term, since he won't care about making unpopular choices costing them an election. And, closely related, a guy NOT running for re-election will spend the time actually, y'know, governing. As opposed to spending 50%+ of his term (of 2 year term) running for re-election, which is these days pretty much a full time job. Term limits can, theoretically, diminish influence of lobbyists, since the lobbyists would have to re-establish relations with both fresh politicians AND their staffs, especially on senior level. Philosophically, having no term limits creates, in essence a permanent \"governing\" politician class, which is fully contrary to the way USA was set up (it's a bit less of a problem for Europeans who are used to their aristocracy and Houses of Lords :) Remember that George Washington specifically considered Cincinnatus to be a role model for a politician. Contrast that with the infamous \"this is a Kenneddy's seat\" quip made in 2012 Congressional elections in Massachusetts. Cons: A genuinely greatt politician, even if he is so beloved that his popularity is through the roof and a large chunk of electorate would vote for them, can not stay in offiice. Frequently, replaced by a complete doofus (my personal example would be NYC Mayor Juliani, replaced with \"No Big Coke for you\" Nanny Bloomberg. YMMV). If one views politics as the art of compromise and dealing, purely theoretically having \"familiar old faces\" arond (aka \"the devil you know\") should help foster more compromise, since you generally have less surprises and know where many other people stand and what their positions and style are."
402,"",NEGATIVE,"In theory, the main argument against term limits is that elected officials should serve for as long as they have the confidence of the people. However, and strictly from my personal observations from Greece, lacking term limits1 often leads to elected officials serving for way longer that they should. The simple truth of the matter is that re-election is a lot easier than getting elected for the first time, even if we only consider that incumbents have a much larger degree of familiarity with voters. The high levels of corruption in the country don't help either, if incumbents generally have it easier (as DVK's answer demonstrates), imagine how much easier it is for corrupt incumbents to hold on to their offices ad nauseum. Parliamentary term limits would solve that problem, without going into details of the following politicians' activities, the length of their presence in parliament alone is not really what I'd call a sign of a healthy democracy: Antonis Samaras, MP from 1977 - 1996, re-elected in 2007 (24 years in total) Evangelos Venizelos, MP since 1993 (19 years so far) Aleka Papariga, MP since 1993 (19 years so far) I'm cheating a bit, pointing to the leaders of the (traditionally) more popular parties, but their very long careers in politics are not unusual in Greece. And although long careers in politics might not be unusual in general, almost 20 years straight in parliament doesn't smell right. I'm sure people will be more than eager to point out that length of parliamentary presence is not really something we should be judging PMs on, and that there are various ways to interpret long runs in the parliament in a positive way. And I'm sure there are, but I'm still strongly in favour of term limits, especially in a country with demonstrably high levels of corruption. 1 The President of the Hellenic Republic is limited to two five year terms, but the office holds little, if any, real power."
404,"How does libertarianism challenge a \"property is theft\" counter-argument to a \"tax is theft\" argument?",NEGATIVE,"An argument commonly ascribed to libertarianism runs as follows: Property is the right (either shared or exclusive) to enjoy the benefits of a particular resource. Theft is the non-consensual deprivation by one party of the property of another. Taxation is the non-consensual deprivation by the state of the property of the citizen. Therefore, taxation is theft. A possible counter-argument runs as follows: At some point in history, someone must have first claimed ownership over some resource that was not previously considered \"owned\". In doing so, they must by definition have (presumably non-consensually, since who would consent unless coerced?) deprived everyone else of the (previously shared) benefit of that resource. Therefore, private property is theft, and taxation merely a form of restorative justice. Assuming that they do indeed subscribe to the first argument outlined above, how might a libertarian challenge the second?"
405,"",NEGATIVE,"I'll take a stab at this but it's not a very well referenced answer, so someone with a better clue is more than welcome to provide a better one. There are two reasons for this counterargument to be invalid in a vast majority of cases where someone is taxed: The main reason this is not necessarily a valid counter-argument is that a vast majority of the taxes that libertarians object to are NOT taxes on a held property which someone may have shared-owned before. A vast majority of taxes being objected to are income taxes. Your income is not something that was previously commonly shared, therefore such a counter-argument doesn't apply. The only \"previously non-owned resource that was shared\" that can be claimed as property would be land, or some other natural resources. Second reason is legal. This one gets really hairy and complicated. As far as I'm aware, coming into possession of stolen goods in good faith does not make one a criminal, OR liable to return the goods. In other words, if a thief steals your TV and sells it on eBay to me, you can sue the thief. May be you can sue eBay for facilitating the sale. But under current criminal law you're not liable for posession of stolen goods if you didn't know they were stolen (and especially if they were NOT considered stolen under prevalent law of the jurisdiction where they were taken, which is the case here). One complication is that purely theoretically, you are not entitled to keep possession of stolen goods once the owner makes a motion to recover them. However, in most jurisdictions, there is a statute of limitations on this. While the intricacies of the law seem... intricate (duh), as best as I can tell, they all start to apply when it is known that the possessor possesses the property; and last several years (2-6 in USA and UK [1]). In other words, since the original owner of the property openly held the property and the \"everyone\" knew of this (most such natural property as land/resources is done in public with the government, so this counts), within several - let's say 3 to 6 years - the statute of limitations on recovery passes, and you can no longer be sued to return the property. TADA. You are now a legal owner, and so are anyone who buys it from you down the road. In light of that, the only person who \"stole\" the previously shared resource was the first guy who claimed ownership of that resource, more likely than not many generations ago. As such, even that miniscule amount of private property that your counter-argument MAY have applied to (land/natural resources) is no longer theft once you have purchased/inherited it fair and square after statute of limitations passes. So, in summary, even if you allow your argument to be valid, the only time it's valid and the taxation is fair under it is if you tax a person who claimed a plot of land or a natural resource (mine, forest, river) that was previously unowned and they didn't pay a prior owner for it. And to be honest, I'm not entirely sure that there exists a unified libertarian position on whether such \"first claim\" property ownership should or should not be taxed. I will ask that as a separate question. I asked a follow-up question to clarify: Are there libertarian views on proper procedure to obtain property that was previously unowned? You can also rephrase the problems with the counter-argument in terms of it relying on a logical fallacy. It takes the assumption that \"some private property is theft\", and extends it to \"all private property is theft\". I'm going to claim that its that Fallacy of composition, but i'm far from rhetoric expert, so feel free to edit with more correct fallacy. References: [1] - \"In most jurisdictions in the United States, the statute of limitations for actions in replevin ranges from two to six years.23 Similarly, in the United Kingdom, actions to reclaim personal property expire after six years24\" - \"THE THIRD TIME IS NOT ALWAYS A CHARM: THE TROUBLESOME LEGACY OF A DUTCH ART DEALER - THE LIMITATION AND ACT OF STATE DEFENSES IN LOOTED ART CASES\" by BERT DEMARSIN"
406,Are there libertarian views on proper procedure to obtain property that was previously unowned?,NEGATIVE,"A while back, there was a fun article making the rounds about some dude selling people \"rights\" to own a plot of land on the Moon. There was another one selling plots in open ocean outside the coastal lines of any states. Leaving aside current legalities and treaties between existing states, is there a \"standard\" position that the libertarian worldview would take on someone taking ownership of a piece of property that was \"common\", or \"unowned\", before? Is it right/moral/ethical to take ownership of such property? (we are talking pure 100% ownership of a bare resource - assume that you as prospective owner have not done anything to develop it, or to make it available) If it is, is it right/moral/ethical to expect to pay someone a tax/fee/purchase price on that resource, since you have - by claiming ownership - deprived someone of a possibility of using that resource which they had an option of doing before?"
407,Are local currencies unconstitutional?,NEGATIVE,"In many places around the United States, localities and organizations have been printing money as a means to drive business toward local establishments and raise money for the community in times of economic hardship. Perhaps the most well established example of this are Berkshares in the Berkshires region of Massachusetts. Berkshares are slightly less valuable than U.S. dollars (you get 100 for $95) and can be obtained at a number of local banks and used in local stores. The IRS even gets in on the act and taxes Berkshares purchases, at their established \"exchange rate\". However, Article I, section 10, clause 1 (The Contract Clause) of the United States Constitution says explicitly: No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility. Clearly the Berkshire region is not a state, but the rather explicit endorsement of the currency by the local government, and the local government's recognition by the state of Massachusetts seems to give the currency the tacit approval of the state. As such, how can the alternative local currency, working to devalue the U.S. dollar in the region, be constitutional?"
408,"",NEGATIVE,"I can't find any case where modern local currencies were actually challenged in court, so it's hard to be sure. Most of the local currencies explored here are probably fine, because they're handled entirely by individuals and businesses. Businesses can choose to accept whatever they want for their goods; if they want to let you pay in apples that's fine, and if it so happens that multiple stores will accept apples as payment, now you've got a local currency BerkShares are strange in that they're not just a form of payment accepted by random businesses: They appear to be endorsed by the local government, even if the government doesn't actually print them Banks will exchange dollars for BerkShares I'm a bit lost as to how they've convinced banks to convert a privately printed currency for legal tender, but that's up to the banks I suppose. You downplayed the beginning of the amendment, \"No State shall ...\", but that really does seem to be the crux of the argument. I suspect any of these things would go over badly with the federal government: Attempting to trade BerkShares outside the state Massachusetts printing BerkShares directly Businesses accepting exclusively BerkShares and refusing dollars The town/state forcing businesses to accept BerkShares Not taxing BerkShare purchases BerkShares becoming the dominant form of currency in the state The last is particularly bad; if BerkShares become more valuable than dollars and are widely usable, there's little reason for the state to care about dollars anymore, which eliminates the main method the federal government uses to convince states to enforce federal laws. If the state stops accepting dollars all together, they become a completely isolated economy and might as well be an independent nation In short, as long as local currencies are optional and stay contained to a small area, it looks like the government is going to ignore them. Trying to displace federal currency or spread to other areas would probably be frowned upon, but I can't find an postbellum instance where it's ever been tried"
409,"",NEGATIVE,"The United States did not issue its own national currency until the introduction of the greenback in 1859. Prior to that, individual banks would actually issue their own notes, which could or could not be accepted as legal tender based on the preference of the recipient. This Planet Money Podcast has the story of how the United States functioned - basically using these \"bank registrar books\" that would help keep track of all the various \"currencies\" that were out there (8,000 prior to the Civil War!). In short, systems like the Berkshare are fine locally, but scale horribly. All currency is a claim on another asset. Until 1933, you could exchange dollar bills for gold. (Nixon finally took us off of that in the 70s.) Nowadays, a note is just a claim on the debt of the United States - theoretically, you could exchange them for bonds. The point of currency is that you have a claim on the assets of another. States are prohibited from being the holder of these assets, as it is a power reserved to the federal government. (For historical reasons, this was necessary to prevent another \"Articles of Confederation.\") Coning money is a different beast altogether than issuing currency. When you coin money, you are declaring a fixed price for the quantity of the material coined. A gold dollar, for example, is declared by the government to be of a fixed quantity regardless of which one you have. (The ridges on a quarter, for example, are there to prevent you from shaving off the material in question.) Were individual states allowed to coin their own money, there could be a variance between say, a Virginia Dollar and a New York Dollar. Even if only in a fractional ounce worth of gold, that variation would have led to confusion. It is thus the equivalent of establishing \"standard weights and measures,\" also reserved to the Congress. More to the point of the question, however, is that there is nothing which prohibits private entities from issuing their own currency. Indeed, all banks prior to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 did just that. The primary impediment would be whether or not others want to accept it. Dollar Bills, on the other hand, even say that these notes are \"legal tender for all debts, public and private,\" meaning that they are to accepted as currency, at full face value for any dollar denominated debt."
410,What is the legality of using foreign law to decide domestic cases?,NEGATIVE,"There has recently been significant discussion in the United States on the use of foreign law, and foreign legal proceedings, being used as a means for informing a domestic judge's rationale for deciding a case. Justice Breyer for example has come out in favor of the idea saying that judges can be informed by looking at the logical process and decision making efforts of judges in other countries with similar laws when deciding their own cases. Legal opinions at all levels already routinely cite foreign law as background. However, given that every case has a unique set of circumstances and foreign law is not legally binding on any United States citizen, could a lower court's opinion be invalidated on the grounds that foreign law was too heavily relied upon (assuming it was not directly cited as precedent)? Is there any discussion of this practice in the code of judicial ethics? Finally, is this a potentially unconstitutional practice in its own right given that the Justice's constitutional duties limit them to \"interpreting the constitution\"? NOTE: This question is distinct from an analysis of domestic laws and potential conflicts with treaty obligations (like this question) as treaties originate from within the domestic legal system. This question is only meant to look at wholly foreign laws, governing foreign peoples."
411,What are practical steps citizens can take to alter a first past the post system?,NEGATIVE,"Given the arguments against first past the post voting systems, I'd like to know what could be done to change them. However, there's a difficulty with proposing such a change to the system, and that's how it favors incumbent political parties. As the people who write laws enjoy benefits from the existing first past the post setup, they are not incentivized to change it. Essentially, only 2 major national political parties exist here in the United States, arguably in part due to the first past the post setup of our voting system. If that's so, neither has any reason to move to replace first past the post. How can citizens challenge such a situation to effect a change in the voting system?"
412,Is there any data on how much gerrymandering influences incumbent advantage?,NEGATIVE,"The US Congress has a truly prodigious re-election rate: 80-90% in the House since 1964, and ~80% in the Senate with the exception of the 1970s (when it hit a \"low\" of 55%-65%) While there are a lot of different factors contributing to this incumbent advantage, it is frequently stated that gerrymandering [1] contributes significantly to it. Is there any sort of data/research available which quantifies just how much of an impact gerrymandering has on re-election rates compared to other factors? I'm fine if the data is specific to US Congress (slightly preferred), or US in general, or some other locale. NOTES: [1] Gerrymandering is defined on Wikipedia as \"a practice that attempts to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by manipulating geographic boundaries to create partisan or incumbent-protected districts\". In plain terms, you adjust the district so that (in terms of re-elections) the incumbent has a higher percentage of his partisans in the new district than in the old one, and higher than the percentage of opponents. This makes the district safer for the incumbent and increases the chances of winning re-election."
413,Granting Search Warrants after the suspect has been pronounced dead,NEGATIVE,"The recent mass shooting at a school in Connecticut weighs heavy on our minds, but when listening to the coverage I noticed something that I could never understand. When the State is prosecuting a suspect, they need to collect evidence to build a case. It is well known that authorities cannot search your private property without a Search Warrant granted by a Judge, and often times law enforcement will do this to search for evidence for the case. In this case the suspect was killed on the scene. Obviously they can't prosecute a dead man, so why do they still obtain search warrants? I understand that we all demand to know what happened and we are all deeply troubled by what has happened, but is this justification enough or is it an overstep of the authority granted them by the People?"
414,"",NEGATIVE,"In the United States, the system of the Electoral College is, for better or worse, really clear in the Constitution. So, the only way to get change to happen on the federal level is to amend the Constitution, which isn't a practical solution. The only insight I can offer is the idea that change can more easily happen on the state level. We may be bound to having electors, but how states treat those electors is up to them. During the 2012 election I heard about the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, where states are agreeing to have their electors commit to the person who receives the national popular vote once enough other states make the same agreements. So, while I'm not too familiar with alternatives to \"first past the post\" systems, I'm sure whatever solution you'd come up with would have to involve the electors. That's not a great answer, I know, but it's tough to change a system that's been in place for generations. I would imagine that some kind of alternative voting system could be implemented at a state level and then, if it does well, could be a model for other states and eventually the union."
415,How to find out whether you're on the left or right?,NEGATIVE,"According to this test, I'm a center-left libertarian. Is this accurate? Do you know any other methods?"
416,Why aren't there more representatives in the United States Congress?,NEGATIVE,"The United States House of Representatives has had 435 members since 1911 or so. But the population has increased drastically since then, such that the average citizen is more under-represented now than at any point in US history. Has an increase to the number of representatives ever been proposed? Why has such an action not been taken?"
417,"",NEGATIVE,"The United States has had a constant 435 members in the House of Representatives since the Reapportionment Act of 1929. The Act still allows for the expansion of membership to occur when new states join the Union, but froze the existing number at 435, likely for political reasons. After failing to reapportion seats in 1921 in an effort to avoid losing the strength in their two house majority, the Republican led Congress (and Presidency) passed the Act to ensure their Congressional power would remain intact for the foreseeable future.

418,"",NEGATIVE,"Property does not tie directly to a particular person, nor is that mapping at all uniform for all members of society. Police still need to get a search warrant to investigate the crime for several reasons, including: Police could uncover evidence of other crimes, perhaps committed by other individuals living or associated with the deceased in some way. That evidence would be inadmissible against the still living offenders without a proper search warrant. Criminals, especially in violent crimes like this one typically are associated with their victims in some way. For example, the suspect is believed to have killed his mother in this case. An unwarranted search in this case could unnecessarily violate the rights of several of the victims as well. The deceased is still only a suspect. Again, in this very case the press originally identified the wrong person as the suspect. It could yet turn out (however unlikely that may be) that the suspect was just another victim and without following the proper procedures, the real murderer may never come to justice. It is often times frustrating to see these types of activities eat up valuable time in the pursuit of a criminal, but given the closeness with which we interact with other people and the seriousness with which we protect and value our privacy, it is important that our justice system operate blindly, even boringly, in its even handed pursuit of the truth."
419,"",NEGATIVE,"Laws and contracts tend to only be binding on the living. But, if I live with a serial killer, a search and seizure would violate my rights as a living person (unless I gave consent, which I would probably do). Next-of-kin stuff comes into play here. If I'm single and live alone and I kill a bunch of people and myself, then as a deceased person my estate goes into the hands of my family or whoever I willed. Someone living is involved now, so search warrants are still necessary. IANAL. This site had some insight into the matter that was a jumping off point for my answer."
420,Why do governments legislate marriage?,NEUTRAL,"Most arguments regarding the role of government in marriage are made with the assumption that government should have a role at all. Why is this? Is it a vestige of a time when church and state were less separate, or are there secular/societal interests that have been there since the start?"
421,"",NEGATIVE,"Analysing the number of representatives in various countries, that number is in no direct proportion to the countries' population. In Poland we have the 460 representatives in lower chamber and 100 in higher chamber, with the population of 40M. The number of representatives is more the compromise between the possibility to represent various political movements and the effectiveness. With 40 representatives it would be hard to represent all big political movements with proper proportions, but imagine 10.000 representatives! The people should know their representatives, and with too much number of them it would be impossible to know even a procent of them. And the work of parliament would be paralised, if each of this 10.000 would like to take a speech."
422,"",NEGATIVE,"Being left or right were obvious when being right was being for monarchy and being left was being for republic. This was the single criterion. Now there are two big factors for distinguishing between the left and the right: the attitude to the economic freedom and social policy and the attitude to religion and conservatic values. This two factor made 4 major political options, 2 of them hard to describe as right or left. For example, in Poland we have PiS, the conservatist described as the right wing. They are for teaching the religion in schools and against the homosexual marriages etc. But they are for the social state: the country should protect the poor and week from the rich and strong, which is considered leftist. So, is this rightist or leftist party? I personally want no longer to describe myself as rightist or leftist. This terms are too primitive to describe current political situations."
423,"",NEGATIVE,"[... I have deliberately left a lot of the answer unreferenced, as it already ballooned, please ask in comments for any clarifications you desire for parts you consider unreferenced ...] The reason there's a lot of confusion and conflict over government's legislation and regulation of \"marriage\" is because \"marriage\" is 4 independent but interconnected things (there may be even more facets I didn't include, but 4 seems more than enough for our purposes): A spiritual/romantic union of a set of people into a family. I'm loosely using the term \"spiritual\" here, since a vast majority of human culture in history viewed such union as being declared \"in the eyes of $deity\". Please note that when viewed from this angle, the government really has no legitimate interest to legislate or regulate marriage. It's basically a Barney view of marriage: \"I love you, you love me, we're a happy family\". A legal contract between a set of people (either explicit, or implicitly governed by prevailing laws). This is of course the main Wiki/dictionary definition. On one hand, as a legal and financial matter, the government seemingly has some reasons to legislate here. However, one can legitimately point out that there's no truly good reason for the government to get involved into the content of the contract (as opposed to its enforcement) between private parties. Here, as in many other aspects, a more classical-liberal worldview lands on \"no reason\", simply because it is a private contract, whereas more pro-government minded people see just as much reason for government to legislate as in any OTHER private contracts (e.g. minimal wage laws, union laws). Additionally, one can also raise an objection of \"even if the state needs to legislate both the content AND the enforcement of the contrasts, why does the state then need to legislate WHO are the valid people to be able to enter into contract are?\". Same story here - both liberals and conservatives consider it very much OK for the state to legislate who gets to enter into contracts (union laws and gay marriage, respectively); whereas libertarians consider it none of state's business ever. An economic union of a set of people into a family to promote economic well-being. Purely theoretically (I won't bother citing research unless asked in comments), people living a family life fare better economically than those living separately, which is beneficial to society at large. As such, the government may propose an argument that it has a legitimate reason to legislate marriage since it impacts on overall economic health of society. Personally, I find that argument weak but I feel compelled to state it as a legitimate one. A cultural construct (an evolutionary stable strategy) which evolved in order to both regulate procreation, and to channel lower-status males into supporting and caring for offspring and society, driven by biological reality of being unable to verify male parentage before the advent of DNA testing in late 20th century (and humans being consummate K-strategists reproductively). There are 3 reasons why governments legislate marriage: A) First of all, if you ask \"why civil government and not churches\", the reason is historical. At some point in the past, churches decided to offload some of the bureaucratic functions on the civil government. I think digging deeper into this belongs more on History.SE, but a fairly good summary can be found here. The main driver turning marriage into a state business in Europe was Protestantism (Martin Luther declared marriage to be \"a worldly thing . . . that belongs to the realm of government\") and for Catholic countries, French Revolution. Please note that marriages were always \"legislated\" to a certain extent, by custom or religious laws. But the registration of marriage was much less formal - for example, in Christian Europe, before 1215, you didn't even need to be married in a church in Christian society, or by a priest. Ditto in Roman times. Also note that in a lot of societies governed by religious governments (At the very least, all 3 major Abrahamic religions), at some point in history there was no difference - even when a separate civil government existed, all laws governing marriage were the religious laws, 100%. That was because in Abrahamic religions, a marriage was basically a religious social construct - commanded by and sworn in front of a deity. Also, from historical point of view, the civil government taking over the legislation from churches was not due to \"having to deal with many religions or atheists\", as a naive guess may be made. The many relgions angle was never in play (E.g. Jewish religious authorities deal with marriage between Ashkenazi Jews in medieval Europe); and there weren't really any \"atheists\" as a demographics in Western countries until well after the state got into marriage game. Also, from history, we see that all societies restricted who could get married (at the very least, most had incest prohibition). B) Second, in the era of public benefits in 20th century, it's a way of distributing resources to dependents. A government which distributes benefits for a family member (Social Security, public aid) needs to have a formal legal proof of dependency. This is somewhat of a facet of definitions #2 and #3 above. C) Third, it's a way to control the society better, sometimes for \"morality\" purposes; to essentially prevent \"bad for society\" (from some governing group's point of view) marriages that are presumed to unbalance the equilibrum of society. From restricting interracial marriage in many states in USA in early 1900s, to restricting \"immoral\" polygamy of Mormons, to fights over gay marriage in late 1990s around the world. Please don't mistake it for \"right wing\"/\"conservative\"/\"theocratic\" phenomenon - marriage was controlled a lot more rigidly in USSR and Nazi Germany than in the USA during the most rigid controls, without any religious component whatsoever. This purpose basically stems from the view of marriage #4 in the list above. As noted, this form of legislation/control was historically almost always present, but usually resided in church and not secular laws. The reasons and justifications vary, but the underlying motivations don't. D. A way to control individuals in society. This is hard to clearly distinguish from (C), but basically this is more about controlling sexual urges/energy of everyone than about filtering out \"bad\" marriages. It was also clearly stemming from defition #4 above, but it was also more about pure sex than anything else (and as such, this form of control very frequently extended well beyond marriage, into controlling sexuality in general. See for example prohibition of porn in USSR). As you can seen, when viewing the marriage from those distinct points of view, a society (as exemplified by government) may have some reasons, more or less legitimate, to legislate/regulate marriage, depending on which view you take."
424,"",NEGATIVE,"Do you know any other methods? Yes. As a matter of fact, the single-dimension left-right continuum is a singularly crappy way of describing one's political views. This was covered on Politics.SE in \"What is meant by the “left” and the “right”?\" and on History.SE discussing whether Nazism was 'right wing' Most modern advanced classifications use schemes with at least 2 variables/factors to describe political orientation. The various methodologies are very thoroughly described in the \"Political spectrum \"Wikipedia article. One of the popular ones is Nolan chart - if your main interest is finding a quiz to label yourself politically, google for that term. Another one is \"Political Compass\" one - as a matter of fact, that's the one driving the test your question linked to. The pros and cons of Nolan chart vs the others listed in the Wiki is a topic for debate, but pretty much any of them is orders of magnitude better than \"left-right\", whose main purpose in modern politics is largely \"how can I better equate my political opponents to some historical monster\"."
425,"In US politics, what are the grounds for the Republican opposition to alternative energy?",NEGATIVE,"(DISCLAIMER: I am asking this in the most non-partisan way possible. Please no arguments or mudslinging!) What are the Republican party's premises for opposing alternative energy in place of fossil fuels? I know that many of them believe that global warming is false and/or is not influenced by our CO2 emissions, but global warming aside, I am having trouble understanding why to oppose it replacing fossil fuel, since most sources are renewable as opposed to fossil fuel, which can be depleted. I am not looking for any debates, I am simply looking for the premises for opposing it. I'm not looking for anyone to defend or refute them, just a simple statement of their position."
426,"",NEGATIVE,"Marriage is, among other things, a contract between two1 people, which confers certain benefits on each of them - for instance: Automatic inheritance rights, without the need to write a will. Visitation rights in the event that the spouse is hospitalized or incarcerated. The right to be notified if the spouse is killed or injured in war. Special treatment as part of the terms of some contractual agreements (e.g. employer-provided healthcare). Notice that these benefits are similar to those typically conferred on family members. Essentially, in this context marriage is a way of legally defining two1 people as members of the same family who are not related by blood, and extending rights typically associated with those of family members to them. Since legal rights are defined by the state, it has an interest in deciding who gets to enjoy them, and may decide, for example, that is or is not in the interests of the state or society's well-being to extend them to people of the same gender, or different races2. 1 Or, potentially, more than two. I'm not familiar with the legal mechanisms employed where someone may legally be married to more than one person, so I don't know whether such marriages are typically treated as one contractual agreement between all of them, or multiple bilateral contracts. 2 Mentioning same-sex and inter-racial marriage in the same breath may be seen as provocative. That's not my intent - it's simply that these are two well-known examples where a state has been faced with the decision of who can legally marry in recent times."
427,"",NEGATIVE,"Sorry, but the question itself is making incorrect premise. Republican party does not, in any way, shape, or form, oppose \"alternative energy\". This is, at best, an honest mistake stemming from not knowing the facts, or at worst, typical political lie by the media. In fact, GOP's official platform's energy policy is officially called “All of the Above” The United States and its neighbors to the North and South have been blessed with abundant energy resources, tapped and untapped, traditional and alternative, that are among the largest and most valuable on earth. Advancing technology has given us a more accurate understanding of the nation’s enormous reserves that are ours for the development. The role of public officials must be to encourage responsible development across the board. Unlike the current Administration, we will not pick winners and losers in the energy marketplace. Instead, we will let the free market and the public’s preferences determine the industry outcomes. In assessing the various sources of potential energy, Republicans advocate an all-of-the-above diversified approach, taking advantage of all our American God-given resources. What they DO oppose are two things, each of them DIFFERENT from \"alternative energy\": They oppose government support (especially, though not exclusively so, in the form of taxpayer dollars) to alternative energy industry to make it even remotely competitive for energy consumers. In other words, if Google, on their own dime, does a bunch of things with energy conservation, alternative energy, and whatnot, Republican party as a whole couldn't care less and may even support that. Remember that oil independence from Middle East is a major GOP platform plank, and if Google invents some alternative energy technology which weans US off of ME oil, a vast majority of Republicans will be happy as clams. If an alternative-energy tech startup (such as the now-defunct Solyndra), on the other hand, requires taxpayer-guaranteed (and taxpayer-subsidized) grants or loans, that's what is being opposed. Attempts to hamper fossil fuel industry by government fiat. Now, this one is, indeed, somewhat rooted in anthropogenic global warming skepticism, specifically the cost-benefit analysis. As a caveat, individual Republican party politicians DO oppose alternative energy vs. fossil fuels, because their own constituents are heavily involved with fossil fuel industry. But that's irrelevant to the spirit of the question, since (1) Democratic politicians in fossil fuel states pretty much do the same thing (See West Virginia's Democrat Manchin); and (2) Such behavior is really industry agnostic, and every politician of every party whose constituents are over-represented in a particular industry will of course behave the same way about competing disruptive industry; and (3) The main opposition is not on alternative energy per se, but on measures to tax/disrupt fossil fuel one."
428,"",NEGATIVE,"Fossil fuels are a finite resource. However, they are still very plentiful. Coal mining in the Appalachian Mountains is alive and well, Pennsylvanians are being told that we're the \"Saudi Arabia of natural gas,\" etc. Because it's the way that we've gotten our energy for generations, the tech is mature, reliable, and efficient. Really, if you remove from the equation that 1) fossil fuels are a nonrenewable resource, and 2) fossil fuels harm the environment, there's no reason not to. An eHow article of unusually high quality talks about some benefits of coal energy: Available Easy to transport Provides low-skilled careers Energy independence Reliable (I saw a billboard around here once that said \"Wind dies. The sun sets.\" That sort of thing) Renewable energy is the future, and personally I believe very strongly in its potential and its importance to the future economy. However, alternative energy just can't match the efficiency of fossil fuels. At least not yet. So, the left wants to spur innovation, in the same way that government dollars and resources got us the Manhattan Project and the Apollo Program. The right prefers that the free market works it out. Republicans are a little more pragmatic about the current benefits of fossil fuels for today. The idea of an established and powerful industry holding some sway over a political party might not be worth discounting either."
429,What are the objections to implementing a flat rate income tax in the United States?,NEGATIVE,"Some of the most heated politics debates are about taxes, and who should get taxed more and who should get taxed less on their income. But there rarely seems to be any debate in US politics as to whether everyone's income should get taxed at an equal rate - e.g. flat tax. (aside from one GOP presidencial candidate in 2012, no other major political figure openly advocated this), which may be argued is the fairest approach as far as people being treated equally under the law. What are the main stated objections to implementing stated tax in the United States?"
430,"",NEGATIVE,"First off we do have a flat tax in the U.S. - Sales tax is flat by most every definition. And property tax is flat by the definition of the owner's income level does not impact the tax (the owner's income level does impact what property they can buy). For income tax, what is equality? Is it the same percentage, the same total dollars, the same level of pain, the same benefits you accrue from our system, the same level of opportunity, or ... Key to your question is what do you want to have equal."
431,"",NEGATIVE,"There are two stated disadvantages: A completely flat tax rate is frequently considered unfair to people with incomes that are below or at minimal survival (poverty) level. Let's assume that we have 3 people, one making $10k/year, another making $11k/year, and a third making $40k/year; with an effective state+federal flat tax rate of 10%; and a minimal cost of living in their area of $9,500/year (e.g. rent+food+other non-luxury expenses). Now, after taxes, the first person's take-home income is $9k/year. He basically can no longer survive on his own income (whereas he could before the tax). the second person's take-home income is $9.9k/year, down $1.1k. This leaves him $400/year surplus, which is 26% of what his surplus would have been pre-tax. He's better off than the first person, but still, his surplus income just got cut by a factor of 4! Third person's take-home is $36k, down $4k. A pretty annoying hit, but his surplus income is down only 14%, compared to before taxes. Not pleasant, but not nearly as impactful to, say, ability to invest in his future. Therefore, a completely flat rate is generally heavily detrimental to people who are close to poverty level. As such, at least SOME degree of un-flateness (via tax credits or lower rate) seems to be a reasonable enough policy, since driving people below poverty level is a much heavier hit on the economy (as they would simply drop the job and go on welfare). Now, having said that, there is something to be said for flat income tax rate at the income bands where the hit to surplus isn't as drastic, if your goal is fairness and equal treatment under the law. For example, if you tax a guy making $100k a year an effective rate of 33% (which sounds about right for federal+state taxes combied), his surplus rate is down ~37%, at 63%. Hardly fair since it's over 2 times the impact compared to the guy making $40k. If he was only taxed at the same 10% as #3, his surplus impact would only be 12%, not 37% (to make it completely fair in terms of surplus impact, his effective tax rate should be a shade higher than 10% (13% by my back of the envelope calculations). This is where we come to the second state objection comes in. Now, the second stated disadvantage of a flat tax policy is that it is \"unfair\" in terms of the absolute amount of after-tax surplus income that people get. In other words, people claim that with 10% flat rate (or even the \"more-fair 13% I calculated above), the $100k/year guy will take home $80.5k surplus income, which they claim is \"unreasonably high\" enough to be unfair to the guys making $11k (who only takes home $1.5K even with no tax) or $40K guy (who takes home \"only\" $26.5k surplus with 10% tax). The general counter-argument to that is that is \"any measure based on absolute amount of take-home pay will be 100% arbitrary - meaning, some person in government gets to decide how much money is 'enough' for you to make and how much is \"too much\". So $80.5k is too much to be fair, but $57k is fair enough.\". If you don't see anything wrong with that, imagine that some day, another person comes to power (let's call him 'Ilyich'), and declares that everyone - you personally included - can only take home no more than $800 above poverty level. What makes that amount any less arbitrary than your decision that $80k is \"unreasonably high\"? You literally have absolutely no logical, moral or philosophical ground to claim that $80k is \"too high\" and \"$800\" is \"not too high\", aside from utilitarian \"there are too few guys making $100k/year who vote, so they are powerless to stop me\"."
432,"How is the word \"populist\" used in practice?",NEGATIVE,"A recent answer to another question on politics.se referred to the Nolan Chart as a method for describing political affiliation. The version of the chart shown at that link describes two axes: Left-wing ↔ Right-wing (defined in economic/distributional terms) Libertarian ↔ (Totalitarian) Populist I'm interested here in the phrase \"(Totalitarian) Populist\", in whose place I would have expected instead to see the word \"Authoritarian\" in the chart. In my experience, \"populist\" is generally used as a pejorative term to describe a politician with the annoying (for their opponents) knack of securing popular support by giving the people what they want - or at least, of promising or appearing to do so. I wouldn't, before seeing the chart, have thought to make a link per se between populism and totalitarianism, but instead, to the extent that \"populism\" has a non-pejorative use, that it describes the political actions associated with a \"bread &amp; circuses\" approach. For example, Nero might be an example of the \"circuses\" aspect of this idea, and Evita of the \"bread\" aspect. Some more modern examples of populist policies I can think of: \"Your boss should be taxed more highly so your kids can go to a better school\" or \"Your taxes are too high\". \"We should stop letting immigrants steal your job\" or \"You (as an immigrant) should have the same rights as a natural-born citizen\". \"You should be allowed to smoke pot if you want\" or \"Those dirty hippies shouldn't be allowed to smoke pot\". These don't, on their face, seem to be concentrated particularly at one end of a freedom↔control axis. Is there, then, a theoretical basis (or real world evidence) for a strong link between populism and totalitarianism? Are there examples of politicians using the term \"populist\" to describe themselves, rather than being described thus by their opponents? EDIT: I've updated the examples, as on reflection they didn't previously illustrate my point very well."
433,"",NEGATIVE,"I would have to say yes. In the 2012 US election, much was made about \"ground games\" for each side. The PBS NewsHour talked a lot about their strategy. The Obama/Democratic team not only crafted and threw a ton of money into making the election into a clearer choice between two very different people, but they had tons of people out knocking on doors, getting out the vote. The undecideds weren't all that great in number, so the Dems in particular thought that the most important strategy was to get their base to turn out. They put a lot of resources into doing so and ultimately did just that. I suppose my point is that the turnout could be a lot worse if there weren't parties spending tens of millions to get their people out, but it could be countered with the thought that if the system was different, more people would care. I'm not so sure. I think that other factors like the size of the country, non-mandatory voting, news consumption habits, and a general apathy within a country that has been shielded from extreme adversity for a long time would have more to do with turnout. It's just hard to get a message out to 300,000,000 people, many of whom don't feel like their lives would be different either way under a new president."
435,Has declaring an official language ever tangibly benefited a country?,POSITIVE,"In the United States, some feel very strongly that English should be declared the official language. One of the arguments in favor of this is that a common language is a powerful common ground that binds people together. Québec is cited as an example, since they speak French in an English-speaking country and have enough dissension to consider seceding. So, is there an example of a country that declared an official language and saw positive benefits as a result?"
436,"",NEGATIVE,"Since the adoption of the 2009 constitution, Bolivia has 37 official languages. Government agencies are required to operate in at least two of these: Spanish, and an indigenous language appropriate to the region. A claimed benefit of this policy is that indigenous people (who, in rural areas, often speak little or no Spanish) have genuine access to government services that they might otherwise be unable to make effective use of (or even know that they exist). I'm not aware of any studies that have shown how successful this policy is; after less than four years, it may be too early to make a definitive judgement."
437,Should politicians be bound to keep campaign promises?,NEGATIVE,"Possible Duplicate: What inhibits a winning candidate from doing exactly the opposite of what he promised? One issue with many, if not most, electoral systems is that politicians do not have to keep campaign promises. Hence, the question is, should they be legally bound to keep campaign promises?"
438,"",NEGATIVE,"In short, you can't because the Supreme Court has recognized the Right to Lie. At least in the United States, this wouldn't pass the free speech rulings of the Supreme Court. The most likely precedent for such a law would be the Stolen Valor Act enacted by Congress in 2005. Here the Congress wanted to do something about people who made claims to certain military honors that in fact they didn't have. (Why this isn't simple fraud, I don't know.) In 2012, the Supreme Court, however, decided that this law was unconstitutional, declaring in effect that people's free speech rights include the right to lie. As such, I can find no way that politicians could be legally deprived of the right to lie. Instead of legislating such a thing, however, many transparency groups simply publish the records of politicians. The idea is that good free speech can potentially drive out the bad."
440,"",NEGATIVE,"First of all, if your complaint is that 'populism' is not even remotely the best term to use for that quadrant of Nolan Chart, welcome to the club of pretty much everyone other than Nolan. Matter of fact, Nolan Chart Wiki entry explains: Bottom left – the antithesis of libertarianism, corresponding with those supporting low economic and personal freedom. David Nolan originally termed this philosophy populism, but many later renditions of the chart have used the label statism, authoritarianism, totalitarianism, or fascism instead. Many libertarian groups have labeled that section as communitarianism. Why? Precisely because, while you can possibly make a case that populism (as is usually understood today, and as you outlined in your question) has some correlations with statism, it is, indeed, a bad term under usual definition, since it does not clearly imply authoritarianism despite some correllations. Here's a modern academic definition of 'populism' from Wiki: Nonetheless, in recent years academic scholars have produced definitions of populism which enable populist identification and comparison. Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell define populism as an ideology that 'pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous ‘others’ who were together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice'. Now, to try and see why Nolan may have used the term, and answer your sub-questions: Is there, then, a theoretical basis for a strong link between populism and totalitarianism? Yes, though it's hard to prove it to be 'strong'. Short version is that any ruler needs support from some demographics as his power base, and lack of active opposition from the majority of the populace. Even if you are a strongman dictator, your power structures need to support you, and therefore need to be rooted in demographics that supports you. For examples of what happens when you fail to arrange that, have a chat with Hosney Mubarak of Egypt (once the bread prices he artificially kept low became impossible to suppress) or Al-Assad of Syria (once his Sunni patronage networks decided that they had more to gain from deserting Alawites). Is there, then, a real world evidence for a strong link between populism and totalitarianism? Absolutely. The quintessential example is Hitler, of course (he was a brilliant orator with highly populist policies - public works to fix unemployment, take property from Jews and give to everyone else, 'you are the superior race', revenge for Versailles, etc...) But many, if not all, dictatorships/authoritarian were the result of revolutions or transitions that had populist policies (Italian Fascism, Bolsheviks in Russia, Roman emperors, Putin's Russia, etc)... Are there examples of politicians using the term 'populist' to describe themselves, rather than being described thus by their opponents? This is covered on the Wiki: Populism, unlike conservatives or socialists, populists rarely call themselves ‘populists’ and usually reject the term when it is applied to them (src: Canovan, Margaret, 1981,Populism, New York and London: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, p.5) Although 'populist' is often used pejoratively in the media and in political debate, exceptions to this do exist, notably in the United States. In this case, it appears likely that this is due to the memories and traditions of earlier democratic movements (for example, farmers' movements, New Deal reform movements, and the civil rights movement) that were often called populist, by supporters and outsiders alike. It may also be due to linguistic confusions of populism with terms such as 'popular'. (src: Boyte, Populism and John Dewey)"
441,"",NEGATIVE,"As much as I'm for honesty, such a system would probably be untenable. What would qualify as a campaign promise? Would it have to be some kind of \"ex cathedra\" thing where a promise is a statement made in a certain way and documented in a certain place, or could it be ANYTHING that a candidate says at ANY time? When President-elect Obama banters with ESPN guys and says that he's going to throw his weight around a little to make a college football playoff system happen, is that now a promise that has to be kept? What kind of \"weight\" does he have to \"throw around\" to keep his promise? More importantly, such a system would hinder the ability to compromise. President Obama really wanted a public option for his health care proposal and genuinely wanted to happen (I think so anyways), but he wanted some kind of health care reform to happen more, and he was willing to give some parts up to get a bill passed. If he's bound to a promise of a public option and Congressmen are bound to a promise of no public option, then stuff won't get done. It's the Grover Norquist anti-tax pledge, except everywhere in government. Besides, even if such a measure is passed, politicians will just hedge, right? It would be no longer \"I promise to get a public option for healthcare,\" but it would be \"I will try to get a public option.\" You do something that shows you tried, and then you're set. For such a system to work, I think there'd have to be some \"on-the-record\" spot where promises would be made...not every stump speech and interview could be scrutinized. Promises would have to be to \"try\" and not to \"guarantee\" that something would happen, and I don't think you would be able to prosecute for not trying hard enough."
442,"",NEGATIVE,"It's hard to answer the question as is, since \"benefitting\" is not well defined. If you consider financial aspects, then having an official language is clearly beneficial - you don't have to spend money on signs, documentation, translators, etc... in either government, or private sphere when it is regulated. Also, in general, from economic standpoint, having more communication and less barriers is usually a Good Thing. As such, lacking an official language impedes commerce to a degree."
443,"",NEGATIVE,"Now, here are a couple of other possible \"benefits\", these aren't quite objective so I split them off into a separate answer. If you consider one of the main aspects of a nation state to be a common culture, then the benefit is that you don't have a part of demographics which is not immersed in such a common culture, adopting common values and ideas. One of the more commonly cited examples of this - though I wasn't able to find any meaningful statistics to back it up aside from very clear anecdotal evidence - is immigration from Latin America to USA. There seems to be a good deal of correlation between strongly leftist political views, especially economic ones (independently of views about illegal immigration) between those immigrants and communities that refused to adopt English and integrate into American society, and those that did. One can argue that a large driver behind this is inherently leftist cultural values in the countries of origin which are retained without exposure to American ideas. This is true both internally to Latin immigrant community, and when comparing that community to other immigration waves (e.g. Irish, Italian) who also came from demographics with strong Left tendencies at the time. Lest someone wants to spin this as racism, the same pattern can be seen in Soviet immigrants. Those that fully integrated into American society and speak fluent English are, at large, strongly economically-right-to-libertarian. Those who still speak only Russian and cling to Soviet culture are a lot more likely to be pro-Democrat. An independent but related factor is that those restricted to small insular community are more likely to lose out on opportunities to advance that the larger country offers. If you don't speak fluent prevalent language, your prospects of higher paying jobs are much smaller. And if the country doesn't have an official language, inherent human laziness frequently wins and people refuse to learn host country lanaguage, since they don't have to go to the trouble, especially when government coddles and encourages this by working extra hard to accommodate them. This is less of an issue in Canada, but more of an issue in countries where multilingualism is due to smaller immigrant communities. An additional benefit is that having multiple languages and not speaking a common one is very frequently merely a symptom of deep cultural divides between population. While having an official language may merely suppress the symptom, it may also help solve the underlying problem; since said cultural divides are harder to maintain when everyone speaks the same language and people are exposed to diverse views."
445,"",NEGATIVE,"In some political systems, this is simply impossible. In most European countries, it is impossible to keep campaign promises, because the system forces parties to cooperate. In this answer I'm writing a bit about parliamentary systems where governments are almost always coalitions between multiple parties, because no party gains more than 50% of the vote. In the most recent Dutch elections, the two largest parties each gained about 30% of the vote, but had largely contradictory promises: Keep tax-deductability of X vs. Reduce tax-deductability of X, raise taxes for the rich vs. keep taxes for the rich the same, etc. etc. The election result virtually forced the two to cooperate; any other majority coalition would have required a large number of parties (less stable) with ideas that vary no less than the ones of the two largest. Therefore, they were forced to surrender some of their promises. In the negotiations, usual results are either an exchange of subjects (party A gets their way on X, party B on Y), or meeting mid-way. A very famous example of such an exchange in Dutch politics is the school struggle, which was finally resolved in 1917. The liberal parties wanted to introduce universal suffrage, which the religious parties opposed. The religious parties wanted to introduce the freedom of education (basically the freedom af any group to start a tax-funded school based on their ideas), which the liberal parties didn't want. Finally, they exchanged it: the liberal parties accepted the introduction of tax-funded religious-based schools, whereas the religious parties accepted universal suffrage. This is called the [pacification of 1917]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacification_of_1917). It has a profound influence on The Netherlands to this date."
446,"",NEGATIVE,"I would imagine your question is akin to asking \"Why is the US President separate from the House?\" It is because our Constitution defines the executive role as being separate from the legislative. The UK's common law simply doesn't make that distinction. The office is not established by any constitution or law but exists only as per long-established convention, which stipulates that the monarch must appoint as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber.

447,Has the Occupy Wall Street movement had significant influence on policy?,NEGATIVE,"In September 2011 and onwards, Occupy Wall Street and its many spinoffs occupied squares all over the world. The meetings shared some degree of dissatisfaction with present systems, but clear aims were not really formulated, nor were there any clear leaders. Now, we are more than a year further, and the question is: has anything changed? Apart from initiating limited debate on the financial system and related issues (for example, it triggered me to move part of my savings to an ethical credit union), has the Occupy movement had any lasting political influence? For example, from this Huffington Post article: Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said: \"[W]e have to be careful not to allow this to get any legitimacy,\" he warned. \"I'm taking this seriously in that I'm old enough to remember what happened in the 1960s when the left-wing took to the streets and somehow the media glorified them and it ended up shaping policy,\" he said. \"We can't allow that to happen.\" Indeed, the civil rights movement in the 1960's did influence policy. Is there any evidence that Occupy Wall Street has shaped any policy?"
448,Has the Orange Revolution improved the fairness of Ukrainian elections according to independent observers?,NEGATIVE,"In late 2004, the Orange Revolution took place in Ukraine after elections that were accompanied by widescale corruption and fraud. Initially, Yanukovych was declared the winner. The protests resulted in new elections, closely monitored by international observers. These elections were won by Yushchenko. However, in 2010, Yanukovych returned to power in apparently fair elections. Many participants in the Orange revolution may have been disappointed in the return to power of Yanukovych. But if this was in free and fair elections, and if elections since then have been free and fair, maybe the actual achievement was not to drive Yanukovych out, but to improve Ukrainian democracy. Has the Orange revolution had a lasting positive influence on the fairness of elections in Ukraine? By positive influence, I mean that the elections are considered fair according to independent observers. So the question consists of two parts: Have elections since 2004 been fairer than the 2004 one, according to independent observers? If yes, can this be attributed to the Orange Revolution?"
450,"In the US, why are corporations people?",NEGATIVE,"In the United States, corporations are people. A movie like The Corporation is highly critical of this, and in a reductio ad absurbum, concludes that the corporation as such can be diagnosed with psychopathy. The movie is loaded with arguments against corporate personhood, but as a documentary, does not attempt to be neutral. On the other hand, a frequently quoted conversation with Mitt Romney, as quoted by The Washington Post: “Corporations are people, my friend,” Romney said. Some people in the front of the audience shouted, “No, they’re not!” “Of course they are,” Romney said. “Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people. Where do you think it goes?” Leaving a discussion on what Romney means aside, what arguments can be given in favour of treating corporations as legal people? Edit: As per DVK's comment, corporate personhood is apparently not limited to corporations. A question who it applies to is rather legal than political so probably off-topic, but answers that are broader and cover not only corporations, but also other non-living 'persons' are certainly welcome."
451,"In the US, is the ban on coordination between Super PACs and candidates effective?",NEGATIVE,"In the US, Super PACs may not make contributions to candidate campaigns or parties, but may engage in unlimited political spending independently of the campaigns (quote from Wikipedia). However, the Super PAC Restore our Future was created to support Mitt Romney, and Priorities USA Action was created to support Barack Obama. Is the ban on coordination between Super PACs and candidates effective in preventing conflicts of interest should the candidate win political power?"
452,"",NEGATIVE,"The main argument (correctly, if somewhat less than articulately listed by Romney), comes from the Supreme court. \"Under the designation of 'person' there is no doubt that a private corporation is included [in the Fourteenth Amendment]. Such corporations are merely associations of individuals united for a special purpose and permitted to do business under a particular name and have a succession of members without dissolution\". (From US Supreme Court in 1888 in Pembina Consolidated Silver Mining Co. v. Pennsylvania - 125 U.S. 181) In essence, a corporation is nothing more or less than a group of people (shareholders) who agree to own a common business. And a state should not be allowed to treat the corporation unequally to a single person, since it's merely a group of people. To do otherwise, it's as if you discriminated against a group of people merely because they happen to own shares in a company, against people who do NOT own shares in a company."
453,"",NEGATIVE,"Not really. In theory, they are not communicating. In practice, Campaign consultants talk to the press, and pretty much express the campaigns POV in public. So it's not like some backdoor communications are required. In general, campaigns do a lot more interaction with the media than before. It's not aimed at Super-PAC (presumably), but has this side effect. Also, most Super-PACs are staffed by people generally close to (aka cronies) of candidates. That was true for both sides in 2012. As such, just like with a long-married couple, speaking isn't always necessary. You discussed all the topics over the years, and know what each other thinks. Mind you, the people involved are always 100% sure to clearly not be violating the letter of any anti-coordination laws."
454,"",NEGATIVE,"On the surface, it seems like the ban is one in name only and may well function as a stepping stone for the Court to eventually allow direct, unlimited personal and corporate donations to campaigns. Priorities USA was founded by Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney both former Obama campaign officials and Restore Our Future has three former Romney staffers on their board. Clearly if there was a need to covertly communicate with the campaign, these are the type of people who would have the access and resources to do just that. Whats more, these are the types of people who came up with much of the campaign messaging last time around, and really wouldn't need much guidance from the campaign to keep on message. Furthermore, public comments made by either side in reference to important issues are perfectly legal, and offer an avenue for indirect coordination to take place as humorously pointed out by Stephen Colbert on his show the Colbert Report where he avoided illegal coordination by communicating with his PAC through his TV show. However, in practice, there are some examples that seem to indicate, at least in this first Super PAC driven election cycle, that the ban on coordination has had some effect. The perceived separation between the campaigns and the Super PACs led each Super PAC to air much more vicious ads than the campaigns ever would. In fact, both Romney and Obama faced criticism from these ads and were forced to plead with the media to believe that these ads would never have been run by the campaign and were a function of an uncoordinated Super PAC. Obama even encouraged his Super PAC, through the media, to pull an ad before it ever aired. Similarly, when the Obama campaign was moving its message off of Bain (due to their ineffectiveness), Priorities USA kept up those ads for several more weeks and muddled the Obama message even further. It is unclear, and without evidence of illegal coordination will remain unclear, if these public departures from the campaign strategy taken by the Super PACs was part of a broader campaign strategy that just didn't work out as intended, or genuine examples of Super PACs making decisions that would have been disapproved of by the campaign. In the case of the Romney campaign there was wide outrage within the Republican leadership of the way the campaign was handling their media efforts and the decisions of the Super PAC were a way to mitigate some of that concern amongst the establishment. Either way, the lack of public coordination had at least two real affects this election cycle: Super PACs could and did run far more vicious ads than the campaigns themselves because the candidate could plausibly deny their association with them. Super PACs often veered off in directions not publicly supported by the campaign, often times in ways that ultimately hurt the campaign they intended to support."
456,Are recess appointments that occur during a pro forma session really recess appointments?,NEGATIVE,"Recently, President Obama nominated Richard Cordray to be the first head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A position created by the controversial Dodd/Frank financial reform legislation, Republicans had been blocking all appointments (notably Elizabeth Warren who was the architect of the department) in that they did not believe in the existence of the department. As a result, President Obama chose to appoint Richard Cordray through a recess appointment to avoid Senate confirmation that he believed he would not be able to secure. However, the Republicans left the Senate opened in a pro forma session (where no business is conducted and the body is opened and closed in a matter of seconds) during the period of the appointment specifically to avoid this inevitability. Is there any precedent indicating that this move might stand up to a legal challenge? Have there been any cases at all where the Supreme Court has ruled on the recess appointment language in the Constitution?"
457,Does campaign spending correlate with popular vote?,NEGATIVE,"In the comments to this question, a small debate emerged about the influence of money on politics. Therefore my question: Does campaign spending correlate with popular vote? The answer might depend on the situation. I am interested in all kinds of elections that are considered \"free and fair\" according to independent observers: local, regional, national elections; elections of parties to parliaments or of individuals to offices; in North America, Europe, or elsewhere. There are probably many examples, so I'm mostly interested in systematic studies."
458,"",NEGATIVE,"This is a loaded question, since you didn't define \"campaign spending\". Spending on what? GOTV? Ads? Consultants? GOTV: This usually doesn't affect who a person would vote for, but can obviously affect how many people get their lazy behinds to the polls. As such, this kind of spending clearly DOES affect popular vote. Ads: This one is trickier. The answer is more complex, and I'll just let Nate Silver talk. The short of it, the asnwer is \"yes, it affects, but the effects aren't as dramatic as usually stated and sometimes only work in specific narrow circumstances\": Campaign ads matter more when the candidates are unfamiliar. Campaign ads matter more when a candidate can outspend the opponent. This simple fact sometimes gets lost because people fixate on the content of ads. But the volume of ads may matter more. Consider the 2000 presidential election. In the final two weeks of the campaign, residents in battleground state were twice as likely to see a Bush ad as a Gore ad. This cost Gore 4 points among uncommitted voters. The same thing happened in 2008, when Mr. Obama vastly outspent his Republican opponent, Senator John McCain. According to some research, in counties where Mr. Obama broadcast 2,000 more ads than Mr. McCain, he received about 1 percentage point more of the vote than John Kerry did in those same counties in 2004. (That a difference of 2,000 ads only appeared to earn Mr. Obama a single point is a testament to the limits of campaign advertising when most voters already have opinions about the candidates.) ... The collaboration between Rick Perry’s 2006 gubernatorial campaign team and a group of four political scientist “eggheads” has made a lot of news. Rarely do campaign professionals consent to randomizing campaign activity to understand its impact, and they should be commended for it. The conditions in this study suggested that campaign ads could matter: Perry’s ads ran by themselves, without competing ads from his opponents. And indeed, the eggheads found that they did matter: the current week’s advertising raises Perry’s vote share by 4.73 percentage points per 1,000 GRPs. Campaign ads can matter, but not for long. that narrative above about Perry campain wasn't over: But equally if not more important is what happened next: a week later, the effects of these ads … receded to −0.17 percentage points. Negative ads work, except when they don’t. ... All told, the research literature does not bear out the idea that negative campaigning is an effective means of winning votes, even though it tends to be more memorable and stimulate knowledge about the campaign. Campaign ads don’t really affect turnout. There is no secret sauce. Really"
459,"",NEGATIVE,"It might make sense to look at this slightly different way. The Supreme Court decision does not pretend that legal entities are human. It says that humans are free to pool their resources and exercise their freedom of speech through an organization they set up. Individuals don't have to belong to 'media companies' to be able to organize to exercise their freedom of speech: It's lucky for the New York Times Co. that the Supreme Court upheld its First Amendment rights. Otherwise, it could not have exercised its First Amendment right to denounce the court for upholding its First Amendment rights. Right? Not quite. As Justice Anthony Kennedy noted in his opinion, the McCain-Feingold 'campaign finance' law--which until yesterday's ruling made it a felony for corporations to engage in certain political speech--exempted 'media companies' like the New York Times Co. (and News Corp., publisher of The Wall Street Journal and this Web site) from this restriction. McCain-Feingold, in other words, granted a small group of companies, including the New York Times Co., the privilege to speak freely about politics, while denying it to all other corporations--not only 'companies … that exist to make money,' but also taxable nonprofits that exist to represent a point of view, including the advocacy arms of the Sierra Club, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association. As for Mitt Romney's statement, I believe Jack and Suzy Welch put it best: Corporations are people working together toward a shared goal, just as hospitals, schools, farms, restaurants, ballparks and museums are. Yes, the people who invest in, manage and work for corporations are there to make a profit. And yes, corporations may employ some bureaucrats, jerks, cheapskates and even nefarious criminals. But most individuals working in corporations are regular people, people just like you and your friends and neighbors. People who want to make a living and want to make a difference. It might be instructive to look at the actual case that brought about the cries of 'corporations are not people!' See Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. In his concurrence, Scalia writes: The dissent says that when the Framers “constitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment , it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind.” Post, at 37. That is no doubt true. All the provisions of the Bill of Rights set forth the rights of individual men and women—not, for example, of trees or polar bears. But the individual person’s right to speak includes the right to speak in association with other individual persons. Surely the dissent does not believe that speech by the Republican Party or the Democratic Party can be censored because it is not the speech of “an individual American.” It is the speech of many individual Americans, who have associated in a common cause, giving the leadership of the party the right to speak on their behalf. The association of individuals in a business corporation is no different—or at least it cannot be denied the right to speak on the simplistic ground that it is not “an individual American.” (emphasis mine)"
460,"",NEGATIVE,"In a purely subjective way, based on my impressions from several visits to the NYC site, I do not think the various OWS happenings changed the minds of a significant number of people. In most instances, there were more curious onlookers and gawkers than actual occupiers. The occupiers did not seem to have coherent agendas. They seemed more to be gathering places for barely connected islands of opinion. People who were already inclined to think that somehow, somewhere, someone owes them some money did not change their opinion. People who did not think that a sociology major with a concentration of revolutionary organizing was going to pay for $200K in student loans were not impressed. They did form useful props for politicians who already espoused or supported similar views in the first place."
461,"",NEGATIVE,"The essence of the objection to a completely flat tax rate is based on a notion of cardinal utility that many find intuitively appealing. It is asserted that an extra dollar is worth less to someone who already has $1,000,000 (Person A) than to someone who has only $10,000 (Person B). Therefore, the argument goes, taking a dollar from Person A would decrease her happiness less than it would increase Person B's happiness, leading to an overall increase in total happiness in society. As an economist who subscribes to an ordinal view of preferences, I cannot accept that as a justification. The cardinal approach allows a person to claim that your property in his hands would make him happier than you losing your property would reduce your happiness, and can be used to justify almost any grab. In practical terms, I think the argument is invalid because income is a flow, and actual wealth is a stock concept. For example, if Warren Buffett chose to stop making income tomorrow, he would be in the position of Person B, but still live a very good life. On the other hand, a budding actor may get her first (and maybe only) major movie deal, and make a boatload of money in just a single year (Person A), only to have it taken away to help poor Person B."
463,"",NEGATIVE,"I'm not so sure what you mean by \"measure the power of the state in the objective way\", it is nearly impossible to measure intangible factors with hard numbers. Quantification of power is, nevertheless, a critical issue and there are a variety of studies and indexes measuring national power. I'll start with an introduction of sorts, hoping to give you a lot more buzzwords to help you with your research, follow with a brief description of two metrics (CNP &amp; CINC) I'm a tad familiar with and close with every relevant study/metric I could find from non partisan institutions. General approaches to measuring power There are several approaches to measuring power, and they generally increase in complexity over time. The earliest model I know of is the one devised by F. Clifford German in A Tentative Evaluation of World Power: national power = N(L + P + I + M) N is nuclear capability, L is land, P is population, I is the industrial base and M is military size Several models followed German's model1, including the CINC (more on that later), that first appeared in 1972. In 1976, Jeffrey Hart, attempted to define the general approaches to measuring power, in Three approaches to the measurement of power in international relations. In very general terms his approaches are: Control over events and outcomes Hart argues that there's no reason to believe that the degree of control over resources is directly proportional to the degree of control over events. A simplistic example of that is the current financial crisis, nations have only partial control over the recovery of the world economy, yet the recession is consequential for all. Hart considers the approach superior to the other two, as it takes into account interdependence and collective action. Control over resources The more common approach that argues that control over a set of tangible and intangible resources translates to control over actors and events and outcomes. The main challenges of the approach is that it's not always certain that actors will be able to use all their resources, intangible resources (e.g. leadership skills, will to use force) are extremely difficult to quantify, and predicting different outcomes demands measuring different combinations of resources. Control over actors This approach is based around Robert Dahl's definition of power: “A” getting “B” to do what “A” wants. The approach largely assumes a deterministic relationship between \"A\" and \"B\", ignoring more complicated scenarios where, for example, \"A\" acts in a way that limits \"B\"'s range of possible actions. Adding to the complexity, these and later approaches, are usually coupled with two major analytical approaches: Top down, with international factors being weighted more than national ones, and Bottom up, with national factors being weighted more than international ones. Furthermore, and depending on the desired outcome, metrics may be: Inclusive (large and diverse set of factors), when aiming at large scale comparisons, or Exclusive (very narrow and specific set of factors), when aiming at predicting very specific events or actions. I think it quickly becomes clear that several distinctly different metrics may be appropriate, depending on what exactly your definition of power is and what exactly you are trying to measure and/or predict. Given that this isn't entirely clear from your question, I'll stop the introduction here and move on to two current metrics. 1 Search for Wilhelm Fucks, Norman Alcock and Ray Cline (for example) Comprehensive National Power The CNP is a Chinese concept and it measures both hard and soft powers. It's a very inclusive metric, taking into consideration natural resources, population, economic performance, scientific technology, politics, military power, culture, and education. You can find a thorough explanation of the methodology employed in the fifth chapter of Michael Pillsbury's China Debates the Future Security Environment. For posterity, these are the weighted factors presented in the book: National Power Factor Weighted Coefficient ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total CNP 1.00 Natural resources 0.08 Economic activities capability 0.28 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Foreign economic activities capability 0.13 Scientific and technological capability 0.15 Social development level 0.10 Military capability 0.10 Government regulation and control capability 0.08 Foreign affairs capability 0.08 It should be noted, however, that there appears to be disagreement within China over measurements of CNP1: In addition to the afore-mentioned political reasons, disagreement over measurement remains a major reason causing differences in estimations of China's power status. To date, more than 10 evaluation and measurement methods have been in use in the field, with basically all using a different type of index. The measuring methods used in assessing China's power status have become increasingly complicated. There are neither common standards for measuring nor continuity in methodology development. The differences in measurement appear for many reasons, though we will focus only on a selection of measurements used to study China's comprehensive state power. For instance, scholars at Tsinghua University of Beijing classify the factors of comprehensive state power into eight categories and 23 indices, while their peers in China Academy of Social Sciences use eight categories and 64 indices; scholars in the Academy of Military Sciences of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have developed a seven-category system which consists of 29 secondary indices and over 100 tertiary indices; and analysts in the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations have proposed a seven category, 115 basic indices scheme in their measurements.Due to the lack of a common standard, neither increasing the number of factors measured, nor using complicated measurements have led to an improvement in the accuracy of measuring China's current power status.

Further reading: THE CHINESE CONCEPT OF COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL POWER: AN OVERVIEW Rich Country, Strong Armed Forces? The Sources of China’s Comprehensive National Power Composite Index of National Capability CINC is a hard powers statistical measure, a linear index of capabilities focused on national assets, that's part of the Correlates of War project1: This measure is generally computed by summing all observations on each of the 6 capability components for a given year, converting each state's absolute component to a share of the international system, and then averaging across the 6 components. The 6 components are: Military personnel (thousands) Military expenditures (For 1816-1913: thousands of current year British Pounds. For 1914+: thousands of current year US Dollars.) Iron and steel production (thousands of tons) Primary energy consumption (thousands of coal-ton equivalents) Total population (thousands) Urban population (population living in cities with population greater than 100,000; in thousands) and CINC's definition of power is2: \"Power\" - here defined as the ability of a nation to exercise and resist influence - is a function of many factors, among them the nation's material capabilities. Power and material capabilities are not identical; but given their association it is essential that we try to define the latter in operational terms so as to understand the former.

464,Did any country introduce a tax specifically on meat?,NEGATIVE,"The consumption of meat is one of the largest contributors to emissions of greenhouse gases worldwide. This is partly indirect because 80% of for-agriculture deforestation is for the growing of fodder for farmed animals (see the sources in this post), partly more direct due to the high amounts of energy required for production and logistics of meat, partly due to rumination, partly due to other effects. For supporting research, see the answer to this and this question on Skeptics SE. Despite all the evidence, policy discussions on reducing carbon footprints seem to be hardly about meat, if at all. Discussions seem to focus on industry, transportation, and electricity production, despite the fact that a reduction in meat consumption would have other benefits, besides a reduced carbon footprint. I speculate the reason it hasn't been discussed is because any suggestion on a meat tax would be hugely impopular with electorate. Speculation aside, does a meat tax exist anywhere in the world? If yes, where? If no, has it been close to being introduced anywhere?"
465,What arguments can be given in favour of financial barriers for participation in elections or electoral debates?,NEGATIVE,"From this comment comes the quote: on a practical level, if you suck as a politician THAT much that you can't raise a paltry $50k in a country with 300Mil population, you clearly don't have enough of a base to be worth invited to a debate The context was that for a Republican primary debate, one requirement was to raise 500,000 US$ in 90 days. As a consequence, candidate Buddy Roemer did not get invited, despite meeting other requirements, such as polling at least 2% in opinion polls. Personally, I have always considered financial barriers for participation in elections or electoral debates undemocratic. In some countries, such barriers are justified by administrative costs. Other arguments I've heard is to prevent a too large number of candidates to take part, but a requirement of presenting at a minimum number of signatures should sufficiently prevent that. What arguments can be mode in favour of financial barriers for the participation of political candidates in elections or electoral debates? (I could also ask what arguments can be made against, but I consider that a rather obvious question and can easily come up with several reasons myself)"
466,"",NEGATIVE,"Wait, wait, wait. You said this was a primary debate. That makes a major difference. That distinction makes the answer crystal clear and obvious. If you can't raise that - relatively small - sum, for the primaries, it means you are going to have trouble raising money for general election as well. (Please recall that 2012 election took something on the order of $1 Billion raised by both general election candidates). Ergo, you have ZERO chance to win in a general election. Ergo, the party has no interest in considering you a meaningful candidate for general election. Ergo, they will not waste the finite resources of a debate (airtime, attention spans) on you. Please note that Republican primaries are internal party affair, which have only one aim - find a candidate who is the most likely to balance winning a general election and represent the party. Someone with small fundraising clearly doesn't even remotely move the scales on the first side of that balance, and therefore is considered to be a worthless candidate. Now, if such a monetary limit was official for general election debate, that would be a different question."
467,Is the United States primary system detrimental to moderate candidates?,NEGATIVE,"The argument says that because candidates must prove themselves as the most potent standard bearer for their respective parties in the primary election (to even get a shot at the general election), it becomes impossible for moderate candidates from either major party to survive to the general election. Is this an innate feature of the party primary system that exists throughout the democratic world in party primaries, or something specific to the United States and its electorate?"
468,"Does any research suggest that two-party systems lead to convergence of platforms, divergence, or otherwise?",NEGATIVE,"Many first-past-the-post electoral systems result in a system where two major political parties dominate. The most famous example is arguably the United States, where the Democratic Party and the Republic Party have dominated politics, particularly at a national level. In such systems, diverging views are often expressed within a party, rather than in a separate party. Despite its name, the U.S. Tea Party operates to a large degree within the Republic Party, and a relatively progressive senator like Bernie Sanders caucuses with the Democratic Party. But as far as the main candidates and overall platform of the parties in a two-party system is concerned, is there any evidence either way to support that the parties tend to diverge in their platforms (polarisation), or that they tend to converge (to where they believe most voters are), compared to multi-party systems? Edit: as for how to quantify this: the most obvious way would be an electoral compass, or some other test that places candidates on a N-dimensional Nolan chart-like graph. One can then calculate the Euclidian distance in such a space, perhaps weighted by perceived importance of different topics. Perhaps there are cases where the answer to the question depends on the weighting, but if so, that is a valid answer to my question, too."
469,"",NEGATIVE,"This is impossible to answer in general objectively (you didn't provide any metrics for what constitutes moderation), but anecdotally, the answer is a clear \"not necessarily\". Two last presidential candidates from Republican Party (McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012) were the most moderate of the field when you discount people who genuinely don't represent the party at all (e.g. Huntsman's positions are more Democrat than Republican; and Gary Johnson is a libertarian odd-duck who as a libertarian doesn't have support from ANY parry :) :( Having said that, there is a definite possibility of more extreme candidates to win in primaries, which is exactly why DNC went to the pain of introducing super-delegates in their convention after McGovern debacle. Rationale For Super-Delegates (from about.com) The Democratic Party established this system in part in response to the nomination of George McGovern in 1972. McGovern took only one state and had only 37.5 percent of the popular vote."
470,Why are voting advice applications not more commonly used?,NEGATIVE,"In The Netherlands, at every national election, the stemwijzer is filled in by millions of people. The stemwijzer consists of a few dozen statements that can be answered varying from strongly disagree to strongly agree. All political parties answer the stemwijzer. Subsequently, when the user answers the questions, they can compare their opinions to those of the parties, and discover what party they are closest to programmatically. Such a voting advice application exists at least in The Netherlands and Germany, and perhaps a handful of other countries. However, it seems that in many countries, no such thing exists. For example, I haven't seen anything similar for the US Presidential Elections, neither for the primaries nor for the final elections. If it exists, it's marginal, and I doubt very many people have used it. Is my premise correct? Why are voting advice applications not more commonly used? (Note that in 2008, the same organisation that publishes Dutch voting advice applications also made one for the US Presidential Elections)"
471,"",NEGATIVE,"There doesn't appear to have been a tax on meat by any country (yet), but there are related taxes that have appeared: The korobka in Russia was a tax on meat prepared in a kosher way, and on this same meat when purchased. Some Jewish communities imposed a meat tax for communial purposes. There are also some meat taxes in consideration: The UK is considering taxes on meat pies and some other meat based goods. Russia is considering a tax on unhealthy meats"
472,"",NEGATIVE,"Since US electorate is considered dumb cattle people with limited attention span for intricacies of policy, the campaigns strongly prefer to hammer only a few very specific messages/bullet points/themes. You will clearly notice this in interviews and debates, where a candidate asked about topic X will very frequently give generic non-committal response to X and somehow turn the answer into how it relates to campaign point Y. As such, providing detailed answernnairs (is that a word?) on a wide range of topics is contrary to this campaign strategy - it simply diffuses the main themes of the campaign. Also, US campaigns are strongly characterized by spin of any information they provide (by opposite party, or the media - which in case of Republicans is the same thing :) . As such, they want to be giving very nuanced answers, with caveats and right words, and as much as possible, stick to scripted answers. Because of this, a questionnaire with question wording NOT picked by the campaign, and frequently with limited range of responses that are either yes/no/finite choice, OR can be spun easily, are not an attractive proposition to them. The questionnaire is more useful when you have a gaggle of people, many of them less well known, running, usually from multiple parties. When you have 2 main candidates from 2 main parties, in a high profile campaign, their main viewpoints on topics deemed of interest to the voters are already well known, so there's no big problem of \"oh! but which one should we pick!?!?!\" that such questionnaires are meant to address? In addition, a LOT of \"independents\" (e.g. people who don't nearly automatically vote for a candidate of \"their\" party) don't pick their votes based on detailed analysis of issues, but on important things like likability. There's a famous quote from Sorokin's movie \"The American President\" which brilliantly reflects the modern sad state of affairs in American politics: You've said it yourself a million times. If there had been a TV in every living room sixty years ago, this country does not elect a man in a wheelchair To people who prefer tall, good looking, likeable/charming characters, wonky details of policy are less than useful. See, for example, this and this, for the height factor."
473,"",NEGATIVE,"Several independent groups DO produce this type of documentation and distribute pamphlets and fliers that voters can use when voting. The League of Women Voters were pioneers in this type of document and still produce them today. Since these are compiled by independent organizations, they tend to focus on a subset of survey information from the candidates that are most pressing to that group, but taken collectively you can paint a pretty good picture of the candidate as a whole. One of the issues that prevent more of this information being readily available on election day right in the polling place (as it seems you are implying they are in The Netherlands and Germany) is because of the very strict laws that states place on the sanctity of the voting place. For example, there can be no political advertisement within several hundred feet (different states have different regulations) of a polling place to prevent people from being bullied into a particular position. This even applies to \"well intentioned\" initiatives and led several states from threatening to arrest international election monitors if they attempted to monitor elections from the polling place as only legal voters and poll employees are allowed in the polling place itself. Finally, the Secretary of State's office in each state is the chief election official and their office produces an official \"for\" and \"against\" argument for every ballot initiative that is vetted for impartiality and accuracy."

What does it mean for a politician to be a \"tea-party\" politician? as opposed to not a tea-party politician. Does it mean they are merely fiscally conservative? Does it mean that they're young? Does it mean that they're outsiders? Does anyone who identifies themselves with the tea party get to be considered tea-party?

However, when it comes to identifying specific candidates as \"Tea Party Candidates\", people typically refer to those candidates that were supported by one of the major Tea Party organizations (Tea Party Express and Tea Party Patriots are two such examples). This is because the organization does not have an official leadership and prides itself on being a \"grassroots\" organization that sprung up organically from concerned citizens. In the House of Representatives there is an official Tea Party Caucus that members can join voluntarily that was founded by Michele Bachmann, however, no such organization exists in the Senate."
477,"",NEGATIVE,"In Turkey, as a legacy of its statist, centrally planned past, sales of meat and fish products are \"regulated\" by The General Directorate of Meat and Fish Institution. This is the largest, if not the only, buyer of animals produced for slaughter in the Turkish market. As a state economic enterprise, its mission is defined as giving \"good prices\" to farmers which translates to paying more than what the farmers could obtain in a private market. Simultaneously, the government imposes heavy taxes on imported meat so that domestic farmers' products remain attractive. The tax on imported meat varies around 100%. This two pronged mechanism ensures that Turkish consumers pay more for all kinds of meat than they otherwise would. Therefore, economically, it is equivalent to a tax, except that it is hard to gauge the exact rate because there hasn't ever been much of a free market in meat and other food items in Turkey (except, possibly, for a brief period in the mid-90s). In the United States, ethanol subsidies make it more expensive to feed cattle. The effect is economically equivalent to a tax on meat."
478,"",NEGATIVE,"Another challenge that hasn't been identified so far is that the system must not make it trivial to sell your vote to a candidate or their supporters directly. Take for instance internet voting, if you were authenticated only with a login and password and didn't have to prove your identity with more reliable means, what is to stop a party or candidate from going into poor neighborhoods and offering to buy login credentials for $10/pop. Given what national campaigns spend, it would be a much more reliable way to sway a close election (albeit risky)."

The idea does not, of course, have universal 100% support. For some people (e.g. high income earners) there seem to be intuitively clear reasons to oppose it, as it will be funded through taxes, depriving them of more income. However, there seem to be opponents of the concept even from people who would either benefit, or at least not be obviously directly hurt, by it (based on income level) - otherwise the proposal's support level would be a lot higher due to income distribution curve. What are some of the possible reasons why people in lower income brackets would oppose the B.I.G. idea, despite no direct negative material impact on them? An extra proof would be if there were demographic poll breakdowns for the idea - please edit those in if they exist."
483,"",NEGATIVE,"A fundamental principle of economics is \"There is no such thing as a free lunch.\" Any income transfer scheme will, at best, make only 50% of the income get spread around (minus any costs of administering the program but also neglecting any multiplier effects that result from people participating in the economy). (Clarification because many people don't seem to understand this. Income redistribution does not create wealth, it only redistributes it. Let's say that there is only $100 in the world, and only two people. In the most unfair scenario, Amy has it all, and Bob has zero. The most radical proposal would be to force Amy to give Bob $50. Anything more, and Amy becomes the \"poor\" one. That is 50% of the wealth. Note that the situation only gets worse if Charlie is here. Now, each person gets a third, and there is only a 33% redistribution to anybody. - there is no way to create more than 50% gain for anyone) Because people are aspirational and not rational, people tend to focus not on what they would gain below the 50% mark, but rather on what they would lose above it. (This assumes that redistribution is always from an asset pool with more money to an asset pool with less. As only half of the money could fall into the \"above average wealth\" category, I suggest the maximum 50% mark.) Furthermore, studies have shown that people's happiness suffers more from losing what they have than what they get from gaining that which they didn't have. (Put another way, people hate loss more than they like a win) None of this is to say that income transfer schemes can't benefit society. (Unequal distribution means that the total number of people can be made better off, and the stimulus effects help) But, as long as people vote with their hopes (of being rich) and not their present circumstances, it is unfair to call opposition to such schemes \"irrational\". (Note: I'm not expressing a position for or against here - just explaining the other side)"
484,"",NEGATIVE,"It would indeed be more efficient (fewer distortions to earn income) to replace the current systems in place in almost all countries. These systems' stated goals are to provide a minimum acceptable standard of living to everyone. But, the systems involve multiple transfer schemes, programs with conflicting incentives etc, usually making it worse for people on both sides of the equation. Money is money whether you receive it through, say, a food stamp debit card, or through a housing voucher, or a school voucher. However, the fact that it is tied to consumption of specific goods prevent the poor from achieving all that they can achieve with the same amount of resources. Therefore, I could support a system that guaranteed, say $25,000/year if it is coupled with the elimination of all the not so itty bitty labyrinth of targeted programs. Unfortunately, targeted programs that benefit small groups at the expense of larger ones are the bread and butter of politicians. Philosophical support for things like basic income guarantees can be traced to Rawls' Theory of Justice whose implication is the maximization of the welfare of the worst off. While it sounds nice in the abstract, let's look at how Rawls arrive at this: They are the principles that free and rational persons concerned to further their own interests would accept in an initial position of equality as defining the fundamental terms of their association. (emphasis mine). That is, he envisions a hypothetical state where you and I are going to be given some cake from somewhere, and says the only fair and just thing is to assume that we have equal rights to this cake and takes off from there. His work is all well and good as a consistent logical system. In the real world we have a slightly different situation. In the real world, you and I each make our own cake, buying our ingredients, putting in time etc. Due to a combination of luck, skill, and effort, we produce our cakes. Let's say my cake is small and tastes bad and yours is ample and delicious. Applied to this situation, inappropriately I might add, the principle implies that part of your cake ought to be taken away from you and given to me. I don't mean to imply that a nice person who shares her cake with her neighbor is doing anything bad. That would be a nice thing to do. But, distributive justice does not concern itself with what is nice. It gives rights to other people to consume the cake you made. True, your bounty had something to do with luck. But, it also had something to do with skill (a combination of luck in natural endowments and past effort) and actual effort. In a society where if you don't have cake, you are guaranteed a share of everyone else's, regardless of what effort you put in, there is an adverse incentive to making cake. In general work is a bad, and leisure is a good. If it were otherwise, you wouldn't have to be paid to work. Everyone would prefer to get their current income without working to getting the same income by having to work. By not having to work, you wouldn't be completely idle, but you'd engage in activities that you find enjoyable but are probably not as highly valued as the goods and services you provide other people. That is, there would be less cake to redistribute. All that aside, I would still be in favor of a system that guaranteed a basic total income without multiple transfer schemes in place, because the complexity of the current system leads to an inefficient allocation of the resources of the poor and the rich alike. Such a level of income is best achieved through a single lump sum transfer and without an individual's earnings affecting the level of the transfer. Things like minimum wage laws prevent unskilled workers from gaining experience by locking them out of the labor market. Other examples abound, but this entry is already getting long."
485,"",NEGATIVE,"As of Giovanni Sartori's Comparative Constitutional Engineering, the number of political parties are influenced both by electoral system and by outlawing some political parties. Citing the example of the post-World War II Germany, Sartori describes the limited number of parties in a usually more fragmented proportional representation system as a results of a the ban of the of right-wing and left-wing extremist political parties by the Constitutional Court. That choice is not determined by the representation system alone as a previous answer (correctly) suggests, but by political decisions enforced by law on how to limit parties and subjects who have to take the responsibility of the government. A previous answer highlights a similar suppression of subjects not by law but by brutalities in non-democratic regimes. The point is that both representational system and the identification of the subjects that are fit for command by ruling powers are essentials in defining the number of political parties, and consequently the governance of a country."
486,What is the origin of the Presidential signing statement in the United States?,NEGATIVE,"With the increasingly polarized nature of American politics, modern presidents have increasingly relied on the use of signing statements to challenge or augment the implementation of measures they disagree with in bills that come to their desk. My question is two-fold: Since the signing statement is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution, or in federal statute, where did the idea originate and what was the rationale behind it at that time? Has it always carried the extralegal force it does today? Given that signing statements occur during the presentment portion of a bills life (described in Article 1, Section 7 of the United States Constitution), in what ways does a signing statement differ from the Line Item Veto that might make it Constitutionally valid as the Line Item Veto failed the Presentment Clause test?"
487,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"The question is a bit too broad to be answered for real, but i'll give a small attempt. Democracy is the only known stable equilibrum in politics - or as close to it as we can get, due to the fact that: There usually is no great concentration/imbalance of power There are stable(ish) ways to respond socially/economically/politically to changes in the environment. \"Developed\" country is defined on Wikipedia as: A developed country or \"more developed country\" (MDC), is a sovereign state that has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less developed nations. Most commonly the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development is gross domestic product (GDP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living Due to the nature of democracy, when the environment changes, you have a chance to adapt to, either from the top (by electing people who aren't as wrongheaded) OR from the bottom (by simply doing things because you have the power - witness Internet economy. In any other form of government, you either have to hope the dudes at the top (who for most of human history obeyed the Peter Principle, and even the good/smart ones are usually not smart enough for complex modern systems of today's economy/technology) get things right, OR, have a violent regime change to get rid of the ones who don't get things right. The former rarely happens; the latter isn't very conductive to economy, infrastructure OR general standards of living."

489,Are there any solid representative district planning strategies that can avoid gerrymandering?,NEGATIVE,"According to Wikipedia's article on Gerrymandering: In the process of setting electoral districts, gerrymandering is a practice that attempts to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by manipulating geographic boundaries to create partisan or incumbent-protected districts. Critics of Gerrymandering might argue that Gerrymandering is overly supportive of those in power, or in some cases the majority power. For instance, in Democratic controlled US states, districts might be arranged or designed to cement Democratic control of state politics. Likewise in my home town Austin, most of the districts stretch hundreds of miles to the borders of Mexico and other cities in order to disperse Democratic voters and to ensure Republican dominance of state politics. The issue I'm concerned with is, how does one fairly design a system that offers neither party, what many view as an unfair advantage in elections? Another problem is that populations and demographics are constantly changing and there is a legitimate need to reevaluate voting maps. So are there any alternate viable voting district planning strategy processes that can avoid the problems of Gerrymandering? What are considered some of the fairest strategies?"
490,"",NEGATIVE,"One attempt that many states in the United States are trying to adopt is to take the power for creating districts out of the hands of elected political officials. Today, in most states the districts are drawn by the state assemblies and obviously they will draw the boundaries in the most advantageous way for their own party's reelection. This became even more explicitly true after the Supreme Court ruled that while it was unconstitutional to draw districts to favor candidates based on race or other protected classes, it was perfectly constitutional to use political affiliation as a deciding point. California recently passed a ballot initiative to hand off the power for creating these districts to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission which is a nonpartisan entity that is not elected. My home state of Ohio voted in 2012 to adopt a similar policy that would see judges appoint a nonpartisan commission comprised equally of democrats, republicans and those from non-major parties. However, in Ohio the vote failed and we continue to redistrict via our elected representatives. A different method that is more popular in Europe and at the local level in the United States is to allow for multimeter districts or at-large seats that limit the effect of the winning candidate taking the entire district and the losing candidates votes being \"wasted\". With multiple members being elected from the same district or votes being tallied for an at-large seat, the second place winners votes also matter, as do everyone's votes for the at-large seat. Since less votes are wasted, it becomes much more difficult to gerrymander correctly as different factions will siphon votes from each other in more unexpected ways. So another option of eliminating the problem of gerrymandering is to change the voting system itself."

493,Is preemptive war illegal or just politically untenable?,NEGATIVE,"In the lead up to the Iraq war, and to a lesser degree in the discussion before the military action in Libya in 2011, there was much discussion in the United States about the possibility that any action would be a preemptive war/war of aggression. Is such an action itself illegal in the United States or any other country, or just something that would be politically untenable for a western democracy? If it is illegal, is that the result of a treaty or federal statute? Are there other countries that have different laws with respect to preemptive war?"
494,"",NEGATIVE,"According to wikipedia: The first president to issue a signing statement was James Monroe. Since Monroe, and again according to wikipedia, until the 1980s those statements where not much more than \"triumphal, rhetorical, or political proclamations\". Apparently they became more popular with a memo from the staff attorney in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel Samuel A. Alito (now Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States), that made the case for \"interpretive signing statements\" as a tool to \"increase the power of the Executive to shape the law.\" Alito proposed adding signing statements to a \"reasonable number of bills\" as a pilot project, but warned that \"Congress is likely to resent the fact that the President will get in the last word on questions of interpretation.\" So to resume the answer to the first part of your question, it seems that until 1986 memo they were not considered to carry any extralegal power. Only after the publication of that memo did the number issued grow exponentially. For the second part I will again refer to the same wikipedia article: [T]he Court may have addressed the matter in Clinton v. City of New York (1998), which invalidated the line-item veto because it violated bicameralism and presentment. as well as In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), the Supreme Court gave no weight to a signing statement in interpreting the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, according to that case's dissent (which included Justice Alito). So it seems that while it is not considered Constitutionally invalid it does not necessarily need to be considered by Justices when ruling. Thus the extralegal power of a signing statement nowadays is only considered important \"if Congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue\""
496,"",NEGATIVE,"There is no federal US statute that says anything about legality or illegality of \"preemptive\" war. All that's needed for war to be \"legal\" is following Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution (practical details listed on the Wiki) and/or possibly War Powers resolution (as far as I know, the latter was never actually tested in front of Supreme Court, and many Presidents ignored it - see Wiki - while Congress insists on it). In other words, if Congress declares war on innocent nation X, that is fully legal inside USA. Mind you, that may cost some people re-election if enough people object to such an action. As far as treaties and international law, a very thorough treatement can be found here: http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/resources/publications/washington_lawyer/january_2003/war.cfm A short version of that article is basically \"it's fuzzy and mostly depends on which expert you ask to interpret things\" The main law which seems to apply is UN Charter article 51: “Nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations….” The rest is, basically, lawyering and semantics. Historically, self-defense was usually applied to preemptive attacks when the target's threat was imminent; however the \"what is imminent\" obviously changed in practice from early 1900s when you could observe massed troops to 2010 when you have technology suitcase nukes (or a cargo ship with a nuke onboard); or tactics like civilian airplanes used as weapons. Again, there is no clear unambiguous law or treaty on the topic, it's all highly dependant on interpretation of fairly vague clauses. I'm fairly certain that Germany and Japan post-WWII had laws to the effect that the military may only be used for defensive purposes. Again, the devil is in the detail - \"defensive\" can be interpreted quite broadly, as it actually WAS in Germany post-1990. The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany (Art. 87a) as absolutely defensive only. Its only active role before 1990 was the Katastropheneinsatz (disaster control). Within the Bundeswehr, it helped after natural disasters both in Germany and abroad. After 1990, the international situation changed from East-West confrontation to one of general uncertainty and instability. Today, after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994 the term \"defense\" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world"
497,How do international rankings influence national policy?,NEGATIVE,"Please note: This question probably has one answer per country, nonetheless I believe it interesting as a comparative question. Jakobi and Lamping argue in Journal of political science (in German) that: Rankings seem to be ubiquitous and also International Organizations use them as policy-instruments to influence national policies. Especially a rather new type of rankings based on complex indicators do have the potential to gain impact on national policies. Yet, an analysis of the policy processes around the first PISA study and the World Health Report 2000 in Germany show that specific aspects of national policy processes like actors and their interests or the point of time in election cycles and policy reform cycles mainly influence the reaction to an international ranking. Characteristics of rankings can make a difference but are subsequent to those aspects of the national policy process. Hence, we suggest to understand rankings analytically rather as external interferences in national discourses than as shocks. Now this is an analysis of german policy, as I believe this is a question that may yield different answers for different countries I was wondering if that question has also been researched in the context of maybe the G20-countries?"

502,"",NEGATIVE,"As @Sinan's answer hints at, the problem with \"basic income guarantee\" is that it is not a stable equilibra, for a variety of reasons. It's not sustainable financially. A vast majority of people, if given a choice, would prefer to \"be lazy\", for lack of a better word (if you don't believe that, explain why you personally don't just spend your every waking moment volunteer working for whoever asks for your help). They won't work if they have an option not to. As such, a great deal of people who work today but don't greatly enjoy their jobs (and dom't make gobs of money over that \"basic income guarantee\" would gladly switch to not working. If you find that implausible, ask yourself (assuming that you work), if you would be willing to be paid, say, 33% less than you are paid now, if that means you get to not have to work. AT ALL. EVER. (remember that working usually entails extra expenses - childcare, for certain, plus cloths, transportation, extra pay for food that - not working - you can now afford time to cook for cheap). So in reality that 33% pay cut is much less; and with the high cost of child care, close to zero for many people at that income level. In USA, 30Million people live at \"just above\" poverty level (100%-150% of poverty level income). Congratulations, you just incentivized 30 Mil more people in USA to not work. Permanently. Forever. It's not sustainable demographically (which feeds into #1) By adding those notional 30Mil to the dole, you will drastically increase the phenomenon of \"welfare moms\", where poor women on welfare have tons of kids (usually, without being married), and get a nice sizeable boost to their income. If you raise that boost from \"a bit of extra food money\" (~33% per extra child for US poverty level) to \"100% per child per year\", the incentive to have many kids multiples significantly. Guess what cultural values those kids will inherit? Hard work and success in life, or \"sit on your ass and get the dole\"? And guess where the demographics equilibra shifts, when the few people who DO work have no time, or energy to have that many kids; yet those who live by the \"gimme\" principle multiply like rabbits? You got it. In a couple of generations, you run out of people who are willing to work, and your whole pyramid of welfare runs out of people to pay taxes for it (or to produce anything). It's not stable politically. Again, as you have a lot more people who are on the dole, they become a strongly dominant political voting block. What's to stop them to vote for whoever promises to increase and increase the amount of \"basic income\"? You already have a similar dynamic in USA - the combined amount of people who simply couldn't care less about federal budget as they don't have to pay any taxes at all; combined with people who sincerely believe in higher taxes even when they have to pay them, became a permanent majority. And the former amount multiplies, since the politicians are smart enough to promise even more people that \"if you vote for us, you also get all the goodies out of public treasury 'for free' - e.g. that someone else gets to pay for\". Please note that this is not an ESS in either of the two localization cases: If you implement such a scheme in one/some countries, people who are willing to work hard will simply bolt for better living elsewhere, eventually. Witness USSR. Tons of people bolted for the West the moment they were allowed to. if you implement it globally, who do you think will produce all of your cheap material goods currently produced by low-paid workers in 3rd world? They are not idiots either - they will happily choose your \"basic income guarantee with no need to work\", given their current salaries. Guess where that leaves you? No more cheap material items. So you have to raise your \"basic income\" level higher since everything just got more expensive (or scarce, which will make it expensive). Please note that none of the above logic would be true if we lived in a wonderful robot-working and robot-serving utopia of unlimited and cheap material wealth (hello, Gene Roddenberry) and energy, effectively making the price of many basic needs close to zero. But until we do, SOMEONE needs to do all of low-skill and therefore low-paid work to produce all of the cheap material goods and services that allow your \"basic income\" to stay so low. So you have catch-22. You either have those items and services cheap enough that \"basic income\" covers them sufficiently - but that causes the labor involved in producing them to be valued lower, which makes it more logical/rational for all the people employed in working that trade to choose to NOT work at all and live off of \"basic income\". Eego, the supply of those goods and services drops, which naturally (Econ 101) causes their price to rise. Which make \"basic income\" not enough to purchase them. Or you make those items and services more expensive right away, to incentivize people to work in those trades. Which make \"basic income\" not enough to puchase them again."

Technically all member states of the EU that have met the convergence criteria are required to adopt the Euro, with the notable exceptions of Denmark and the United Kingdom who managed to obtain special opt outs in the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht. According to Article 50 (3) of the Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union, if a country withdraws from the European Union all treaties regarding the EMU, starting with the Treaty of Maastricht, will no longer apply, which effectively means that a Eurozone member withdrawing from the EU will also be withdrawing from the Eurozone: 3.

Lastly, there is nothing legally stopping a country that has withdrawn from the EU to adopt or continue using the Euro as its national currency, similarly to how Monaco, San Marino, the Vatican City, Kosovo, Montenegro and Andorra have adopted the Euro without being members of the EU and without being represented in the Euro Group. This seems like a far more likely possibility, assuming of course that the withdrawing member is interested in adopting or continuing using the Euro."

506,"",NEGATIVE,"At the presidential level in the United States it is certainly true that a college degree has become effectively mandatory for candidates. In total, only 10 Presidents did not graduate from college at all, and Harry Truman is the only such example after the 19th century. However, that does not seem to imply that title bearing degrees past an undergraduate level have proven beneficial in the United States. Only 6 Presidents received law degrees, only George W. Bush has an MBA and Woodrow Wilson was the only Ph.D. to become President. In Congress, the trend is very similar and in the 111th Congress a full 95% of the members had some level of educational degree. In Congress it seems that the education level is marginally higher than for our Presidents with most holding at least a masters degree. In fact, roughly 40% had a law degree and another 20% had some type of masters degree. Only 23 members of the House of Representatives were Ph.D. recipients however. From this evidence, it appears that on average Americans prefer a candidate with some level of education past high school, but that a title or specific specialization is not important to them.

511,"",NEGATIVE,"Since you cannot impose a politician to keep a promise without threatening him to revoke his status, what you're really asking for is the imperative mandate for the elected. You shouldn't because you can't. This practice is forbidden in several Representative democracies, starting from French Constitution of 1791 because it's a contradiction of the representative principle itself. As an example I can cite the article 67 of the Constitution of Italy: Each Member of Parliament represents the Nation; members shall carry out their duties free from imperative mandate. Nowadays, some parties like the Pirate Party use platform like Liquid feedback to enforce elector choices. Still, since these parties operate in a Representative democracy and not in a direct democracy, those are only suggestions that politicians can ignore. On the other hand, expulsion of an elected from a party cannot means expulsion from the Parliament, so usually the elected cannot be removed from his/her duties without a vote by the house where he/she was elected. Those cases are rare even in the US, 5 in history for the House of Representatives as of 2012. Briefly: the only serious bond (removal, expulsion) applied to elected politicians would be usually unconstitutional in most of Representative democracies and shouldn't and cannot be applied."

A simple, easily verifiable solution is not one that benefits the dominant parties since they spend a good deal of time after the election challenging results.

There are lobbyists that are fighting for more complex and flawed solutions that would through tons of money at donor companies to pretend to provide a solution knowing it will not solve the problems that they do not actually want to solve. The internet is not secure. The nature of the internet means that it is basically impossible to hide the servers that are running the election. having ~20 million people attempting to vote over less than 24 hours means that it will require many servers and if even one gets compromised the entire election results could be spoiled. Super high security targets like these would have to be are targets of hackers because of the difficulty. This would be their Mount Everest. And they could do it from someplace that was safe from US law enforcement. There is a barrier to the population to convince them that it is safe and secure to vote online anonymously. The nature of the technology required would make it trivially possible to link the votes to the voter if they have access to the servers running the internet. Our government officials have shown nothing more clearly than they can not be trusted with the election. Even if it wasn't the actual candidates then there is still the giant group of people who work on the campaign. Any of these that might gain access to the election systems creates a risk of failure. In a super centralized election process like this would be a failure that invalidates one vote calls the entire process into question."
514,"",NEGATIVE,"Well, first of all, we can take a look at the lessons of history: They get other jobs. When industrial agriculture automated many farm jobs, the people migrated to the industries (wasn't the only or even main driver, industries also paid better and were safer, by comparison; but the point is, they did it). When automation was introduced into production process, by Ford and then even more, the people working those jobs either re-trained for other jobs, or moved into services. So, one feasible \"change\" would be to do nothing, and let the free market create new industries (compare the number of people employed in software development today compared to 1950). They migrate to services, as products become cheaper. There was an interesting dynamic happening recently, which has to do with basic economics: Many basic things became cheaper to produce (e.g. cloths, utensils, etc...) This allowed poor people to spend less of their income on such necessities The freed up money went to the services/entertainment industry. (have a look at how much money many of the ostensibly \"poor\" people spend on entertainment and services, such as fast food/haircuts/whatnot in inner cities). Now, this is important, because services/entertainment, unlike manufacturing, are much harder to automate, or offshore; and are pretty much in infinite demand. This one is oldie but goodie: they do what their ancestors did BEFORE them eggheads invented all the industrial revolution stuff. ANYONE can go and farm a plot of land. This may not always be sufficient for existance, but would make item #4 a lot more feasible - ask anyone from USSR who had to work on their \"ogorod\" (mini farm) aside from their main paying job, due to food shortages. They become public assistance recipients (welfare, basic income, whatever you call it). Now, this one is difficult. Can it be done in general? Of course. Can it be done as a feasible, long-term stable and sustainable solution? The answer greatly depends on just how much the appearance of robots made the basic material goods cheaper than before. I would (and did at the link) argue that at the current stage of robotics, it's not yet feasible in terems of being a globally stable and sustainable solution. It WILL become feasible once you get VERY Cheap energy - fusion, geothermal, whatnot - not strongly dependent on expensive commodities like fossil fuels or land+materials for solar batteries or wind. Commoditized cheap manufacturing of goods. The 3D printing technology sounds like a very feasible approach of attack on this Cheap food. Production of that requires the energy, AND stopping religious environmentalists from ludditizing agricultural progress. Cheap water. Same as food - very feasible with energy. Israel perfected desalinization technologies, but they aren't cheap because of energy requirements yet. Land to build housing on. This one is politically tricky, but an argument can be made that the cost of living for the poor is very high because they freqiently live in large cities; where the land is very expensive. If you get your \"basic income\" recipients to accept as a condition of that that they must move somewhere else, where land is plentiful and cheap (which is a lot of places in the world - not every place is Tokyo), you solve that problem. Again, the main dependency is cheap energy, so people who live far away from big cities can actially have cheap delivery of their basic needs."
515,"",NEGATIVE,"This very question was at the heart of Jeremy Rifkin's The End of Work. Way back in the mid-90s, already, he was noticing that low-skilled work in particular was being mechanized to the point where large numbers of people would be without work. One major emphasis of his was that work weeks should be reduced in order to give less work to more people. The 35-hour French Work Week was, for Rifkin, a model of fairness, allowing people to have two jobs where needed or to maintain one and have leisure time. In his understanding of labor, the move from the 12 hour day to the 10 hour day to the 8 hour day was progress, in that leisure was a good in and of itself. By adding leisure to more people, overall benefit accrues to society. Secondly, he forsaw the rise of the non-profit sector to take the place menial, automatable jobs. While I may not agree withe his prediction, the truth is that the \"service\" economy, of which the non-profit sector tends to be a part, is in fact where the bulk of new labor is growing. The comparative advantage in time of the unskilled lends itself to service, in that non-automatable tasks will always exist, and everyone has the same amount of time."

518,"",NEGATIVE,"In the age of Empire, these were totally different things. A nation was an ethnological term - it referred to a people group. A state, on the other hand, was a governmental authority. As such, the Austro-Hungarian Empire would have been a single state with mutiple nations - including Austrians, Magyars (Hungarians), Gypsies, and others. With the breakup of Empires generally, however, the goal came to be that each people group (nation) would have its own state - the nation-state - in which it could pursue its own identity."
519,"",NEGATIVE,"There are three different things to define here: State: \"A state is an organized community living under a unified political system, the government\" (Wiki definition). This is basically just a community (usually in a specified territory) that was ruled by a specific government. It may or may not have been sovereign. Nation: A nation may refer to a community of people who share a common language, culture, ethnicity, descent, or history (Wiki). Note that a nation has no required geographical tie-in (as an extreme example, consider the nation of Roma, or post-Diaspora-pre-modern-Israel Jews). But they must/should, as a rule, share history, culture and language (never thought I'd quote Stalin on a Politics.SE :) The idea of a nation and a state being the same thing (\"Nation-state\") is fairly new in modern politics[1] (it came about as one of the consequences/results of Peace of Westphalia, which ended the 30-year-war in Europe, when the concept of \"Westphalian sovereignty\" was introduced). Before that, a vast majority of people did not - per se - had a firm notion of a \"nation\", at least in Europe. Your loyalties were either to your immediate locale (village, town, clan), or to your hierarchical ruler (feudal lord, usually, and ultimately whichever prince/Emperor ruled the whole territory of the state). But you didn't consider the territory ruled by that Emperor to be \"your\" state - the fact that they shared the ultimate liege lord was irrelevant both practically, AND philosophically/culturally. Also, as alluded to by @Affable's answer, most of the states through history did NOT match the notional nations geographically, and many crystallized as nations much later than 1648. For example, Russia at first had a gazillion city-centered small states. Then, when they were unified under a central government, they fairly promptly ate up the territories of OTHER nations and turned into transnational empire, which they still in effect are. Germany wasn't really unified as a nation till either Congress of Vienna in 1815 or even Bismarckian unification in mid-19th century. Italy was a collection of warring states till 1861 or so. Islamic empires/khaliphates were transnational and Arab Nationalism didn't really exist till 20th century, after Ottoman Empire was gone. [1] - There were earlier attempts and ideas to create a nation-state - for example, I would consider Alexander the Great's efforts to be such, since he tried to unify the culture of his empire (and definitely succeeded doing so in the scope of Greek Peninsula itself). I'm not sure how to classify Rome - they tried to also strongly unify the culture of their empire, and had a Latin as common language."

The 1994 law in theory banned AK-47s, MAC-10s, Uzis, AR-15s and other 'assault weapons'. Yet the gun industry easily found ways around the law and most of these weapons are now sold in post-ban models virtually identical to the guns Congress sought to ban in 1994 -What constitutes an assault weapon? -Which guns were banned, and how did their post-ban models differ?"

Certain modifications to semi-automatic pistols and semiautomatic shotguns. (these are pretty similar to the rifle ban and can be found on wikipedia, I won't list them here). As you can see, most of the things included in the ban were cosmetic enhancements to a gun. It would be impossible to list specific models as many guns are customizable with any and all of the enhancements that are listed here. So a few specific guns (those listed in the question) were banned, but mostly the ban was governing the style of rifles that could be sold, not the models. This graphic from the Violence Policy Center shows the modifications made to popular guns to make them compliant with the assault weapons ban. Model numbers we changed, and features were modified (note the lack of a flash supressor on the TEC AB-10, the shorter clip on the Match Target etc), the SSR-74-2 is based on the AK-74 (same family as the AK-47), but uses a different caliber bullet. (It should be noted that as with the SSR-74, some of these are more than cosmetic changes, this is due to the entire model being banned, not the cosmetic bans) As far as how the banned models differed. You'd see a shotgun with either a folding stock or a pistol grip, not both. Or a rifle with just a pistol grip, but not a folding stock. Or just a bayonet mount, but not a pistol grip, or folding stock. There was one provision that did have to do with ammunition capacity. High capacity magazines were banned under the law. The law set the maximum capacity for a magazine at 10."

525,"",NEGATIVE,"According to John Locke at least, and as he says in his Second Treatise of Civil Government, when you are born into a country, live there and take advantage of its offerings (acquire property specifically), and more importantly, of your own free will choose not to leave that country to pursue a life elsewhere, you give your tacit consent to the laws and customs of the country you live in. An excerpt dealing with the idea of tacit consent is below: Sec. 110. Thus, whether a family by degrees grew up into a common-wealth, and the fatherly authority being continued on to the elder son, every one in his turn growing up under it, tacitly submitted to it, and the easiness and equality of it not offending any one, every one acquiesced, till time seemed to have confirmed it, and settled a right of succession by prescription: or whether several families, or the descendants of several families, whom chance, neighbourhood, or business brought together, uniting into society, the need of a general, whose conduct might defend them against their enemies in war, and the great confidence the innocence and sincerity of that poor but virtuous age, (such as are almost all those which begin governments, that ever come to last in the world) gave men one of another, made the first beginners of commonwealths generally put the rule into one man's hand, without any other express limitation or restraint, but what the nature of the thing, and the end of government required: which ever of those it was that at first put the rule into the hands of a single person, certain it is no body was intrusted with it but for the public good and safety, and to those ends, in the infancies of commonwealths, those who had it commonly used it. And unless they had done so, young societies could not have subsisted; without such nursing fathers tender and careful of the public weal, all governments would have sunk under the weakness and infirmities of their infancy, and the prince and the people had soon perished together. As Locke points out, it is originally your parents who made that agreement with the state for you, but as you are bound to them, so are you bound to the state. Certainly then when you become of age to make your own decisions, your decision to stay a citizen of that country and accept the property and belongings willed to you by your parents upon their death, renews that tacit consent for yourself. This is obviously not a universally held theory and as this article explains, Robert Nozick argues in Anarchy, State and Utopia Locke's mistake is assuming that the original transfer of ownership to the first father in the chain does not come with an obligation to the state, as Locke assumes. Thus, when passing it down to his son, that obligation does not persist. Furthermore, ownership allows the bearer the right to do whatever he wants with the property, and this should include taking it out of state control. However, most modern democratic systems are based at least in part on Locke's writings, and its his idea of tacit consent at work here."

More recently in the UK the Liberal party has strengthened its position. In the Canadian 1993 election, the government went to fifth place in number of seats. In the Canadian 2011 election the NDP becoems the official opposition for the first time, ousting the Liberal party.

533,"",NEGATIVE,"Governments that implement the type of programs you refer to typically believe that their are people they represent who are unable to meet their dietary requirements through their own means. Politicians supporting such policies often claim that increased domestic security for more people lead to more active job/community participation which raises additional tax revenues from the individuals as well as the businesses they frequent and society benefits as a whole. In the United States in 2011 14.9% of all households were food-insecure for at least part of the year, meaning that eating patterns for at least one member of the household were disrupted at some point during the year due to financial restrictions according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Of those households, 57% percent participated in one or more of the food assistance programs that you highlighted in your question. For all participants in these programs the average monthly net income per household was $336. SNAP benefits were received by 15.5% of Americans in September 2012 implying that some percentage of those were not food insecure, though it is impossible to tell what the food insecurity number would be if no one received assistance. The USDA also estimates that between 3-10% of people who are eligible for food stamps are not taking advantage of the program today. The average length of SNAP participation for new recipients is 8-10 months. Despite this, there are a significant number of active recipients that have been on the program for extended periods of time. The USDA reports these two seemingly contradictory facts about participation lengths: Half of the individuals entering the program during the 1990s received benefits for eight months or less; nearly four out five left the program within two years (see figure below). Half of all participants in a typical month during the mid-1990s were in the midst of a spell (a period of continuous participation) that had lasted more than 4½ years. A full 80% of all new participants leave the program within the first 2 years. The full report I was able to dig up is not the most recent analysis, but it can be found here.

You can see http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-ilaw.htm or anything similar, the best are printed academic publication, but I have them only in Polish, so I can't cite them directly here :) However, the 'preemptive war' is a tricky term, because it suggest self-defense which is not forbidden by international laws. The problem is, how to define self-defense and where is the border between preemptive self-defense and the aggression. The term 'war' may be used internally, especially in political campaigns, but on international level it is avoided and the term 'intervention' is often used. Especially 'humanitarian intervention'. In Libya there was the civil war, so it was easy to present one side as innocent victims and the other as oppressors and use it as pretext for intervention."

When it's going about the adoption of children, the people are afraid that it could be the disadvantage for children to grow up in homosexual marriages as compared to heterosexual ones. The problem is quite new and there are no long-term studies yet (defining long-term as generations, not years). Of course those are arguments from people accepting civil unions as such.

The present world system operates on agreement and consensus, but only has as much power as the member states choose to cede to it. There are several treaties and conventions (UN High Charters, Geneva Convention, etc...) but these do not have any more force of law than countries choose to give it. If they withdraw from any convention or treaty, there would be public censure, but no actual \"legal\" action that an authority could take. Whether or not the 'rest of the world' chose to go after such a state is a different matter, but that is diplomatic action, again, not 'legality.' The United States, for example, has not signed on to the International Court of Justice (for fear that its soldiers may be prosecuted). As such, if a foreign country wants to prosecute an American soldier, the only authority it has to do so is the authority that United States allows the other country. Likewise, the United States refused to participate in the League of Nations, and thus could and would ignore its actions. Technically, the Kellogg-Briand Pact outlawed war - in 1928. It was just a treaty. See how effective it was? The situation could be likend to membership in a church. Churches can, in theory, can impose punishment on its members - but because people are free to join and leave churches as they choose, in practice there is no church discipline. A member who violates the agreed upon rules can be censured or expelled, but beyond that, there is no power to force or compel. States that enter into \"illegal wars\" can be censured, sanctioned, yelled at very, very, loudly - and if the rest of the world so decides - invaded or attacked.

As our politicians wrestle with the viability and effectiveness of these schools as an alternative or outright replacement for the public model, are there proven private systems in place today around the world? That is: Are there examples of private, for profit schools that achieve higher educational attainment levels for their students, higher graduation and placements rates, etc. around the world? What is the most common model around the world (public, private, hybrid)? UPDATE: I am specifically interested in private, for profit, schools below the college/university level.

In essence, they worry that the side advocating same sex marriage will pretend to agree to the \"civil union\" compromise, but push till full recognition once that's achieved (which would be much easier of a step at that point). This is comparable to other concerns over previous political compromises between conservatives and progressives, such as balancing the budget (e.g. one side agrees on raising taxes in exchange for drop in spending... lo and behold, a bit later, the spending is either never dropped, or raised back, while taxes are already permanently raised); or immigration (where allowing amnesty during Reagan time was supposed to be countered with border security... amnesty was granted, border security never happened). To put it in Middle Eastern political terms, in their experience they expected peace, but got a hudna - which is a temporary ceasefire explicitly aimed with one side (or both) intending to continue the conflict once the ceasefire ends. Strategically, that makes people more resistant to compromise and deal-making."
539,"",NEGATIVE,"Yes, there are plenty of proven private schools. Since you edited the question to restrict to secular, secondary schools, here's an example for you: Phillips Exeter Academy. 3 of the 12 top finalists at 2012 USA Mathematical Olympiad studied there, that should probably satisfy you as far as the school's provenness or success. First, pre-K education have been private in USA, always. Proven and successful as a private institution. An argument may be made about whether pre-K is considered \"educational\". What I was referring to were specifically pre-K schools as opposed to \"daycare\" where the goal is to simply park a child for the day; as I'm only familiar with the former. While I would not make a blanket statement about every pre-K institution in the USA, the ones I am personally familiar with from personal evaluations all had a level of education for its pre-K graduates matching or exceeding a typical grade 2 in American public school (including simple multiplication and fluent reading at Grade 2 level). College/university system was private in the USA from inception. To this day, all the top level institutions are private despite some fairly respectable city/state ones evolving to compete with them over the last century. US World &amp; News Report rankings (considered the \"main\" ranking system for US universities, or at leas the one most people think of when they think rankings) lists 10 of the top 10 as private. Obviously, religious schools are private. While some only teach religious subjects, many offer full range of academic curriculum. In general, there are plenty of private schools around the world. Since copy/pasting from a very large Wikipedia article seems rather pointless, I will merely provide a link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school . Sweden is a particularly frequently cited example. As a newer answer mentioned charter schools, I'd be remiss not to mention CREDO studies (done by Standord U). E.g. 2013 study found that: Overall, it showed charters out-performing TPS by .01 standard deviations in reading and scoring about the same as TPS (public schools) in math However, that \"almost same\" result masks the truly important statistic, which is impact specifically on the most unsuccessful public school demographics (ESL Latino and poor Black students). In those 2 segments, charter schools performance far outstripped public schools: We also find differing impacts among various student groups, as summarized in the Table 19 above. The biggest impacts are among Hispanic students who are English language learners; they gain 50 additional days of learning in reading and 43 additional days in math from charter attendance per year. Black students in poverty at charter schools gain 29 additional days in reading and 36 additional days of learning in math. ...Students in poverty, English language learners, and special education students all benefit from attending charter schools as well. Because these are students generally considered to be underserved by the TPS system, higher quality educational options for these groups are of particular interest. Considering the fact that there are both private and public schools in India, USA, post-USSR Russia, UK and Germany, I would venture to guess (without bothering to add up populations) that a hybrid model seems to be the most prevalent. I'm guessing the only super large country with purely public model may be PRC. Moreover, it seems that what most politicians are wrestling with is not whether a concept of private school system is \"proven\", but with the pressure from public school lobby which rightfully sees private schools as a threat to both their funding and their position of power."
540,"Could raising the tax on the wealthy, without cutting spending, balance the federal budget in the US?",NEGATIVE,"Some of the stalemate over the Fiscal Cliff has been over whether to raise the tax rate on the wealthy in order to raise additional revenue. One argument that is frequently made is that the main problem is not revenue, it is the level of spending. More specifically, that no amount of tax revue from the wealthy would be enough to cover the current spending levels. Is that argument in favor of bigger spending cuts sound? Can it be substantiated with actual numbers? If you would consider the \"wealthy\" to be everyone who earns more than one million per year in income or capital gains (which was a cutoff for many proposals over the last two years), could taxing their income at any level fund the current federal government spending? If yes, what would the effective tax rate have to be? If no, what is the most you can fund at 100% effective rate? (assume 2012 revenues and spending). (Note: No one is asking the rich to pay 100% of their income over a certain level, but this question is about whether the budget deficit is theoretically addressable without major spending cuts.) NOTE: I'm not looking for discussions over whether such taxes are fair or not. Merely how the two numbers compare. The answer should consist of the following numbers: Current federal spending deficit for 2012 (revenues - spending) Total income of those earning $1mil + for a year If #1 &lt; #2, what % of #2 is #1? If #1 > #2, what amount and % of deficit is not covered? To be clear, the \"deficit\" discussed here is the annual deficit, not the total federal debt."

I know \"morally wrong\" is a huge can of worms, but people make those sorts of distinctions in politics all the time. Policy endorses one man and one woman, but has decided that one man and three women is no good. The man and the woman can't be brother and sister (it doesn't matter if they don't want to reproduce or if they really love each other or anything like that...incest is illegal in 49 of 50 states in the US), and they both have to be consenting adults. The basis of one's morality at the political table is, again, a huge can of worms, but those who object to civil unions do so because they believe that they are wrong. Here's an article for some further reading on the subject. It talks about why the author believes that the issue of homosexuality has little to do with the civil rights movement and intermarriage conflicts."
543,"",NEGATIVE,"Many countries significantly reduced their debt by defaulting on it. Philip II, king of Spain and Portugal, repeatedly (in 1557, 1560, 1575, and 1596) expropriated his creditors after overspending on wars. In 2001 Argentina defaulted on about 100 billion USD of its foreign debt. More recently (March and April 2012), Greece defaulted on €107 billion owed to foreign creditors. See Wikipedia for a list of sovereign defaults. This policy has certain undesirable results, and is best avoided. Venezuela found itself in a military confrontation with the UK, Germany, and Italy in 1902, after halting debt payments. Argentina keeps getting its ships detained by creditors, and has been unable to borrow on the international money market since its default. Greece has been forced to implement unpopular austerity measures as a condition of its debt restructuring. But it does reduce debt."
544,"",NEGATIVE,"In the originally-envisioned system, Presidential electors are appointed by the states; the states decide how those electors are chosen. Accordingly, states could hold an election, but in most the state legislature chose the electors. Since the Civil War, all states have chosen electors according to popular vote, but ballot access rules (for the general election) are still determined by the states. At present, Presidential primaries are theoretically run by the parties, who can make their own ballot-access rules. (But they may be subject to restrictions under state law.) Effectively, major-party candidates must follow their party's procedure to gain primary ballot access; third-party or independent candidates (or major-party candidates that lost their primary but want to continue their campaign) must follow the state procedure. Typical requirements include submitting some number of registered voters' signatures and paying a filing fee; alternatively a candidate nominated by a party that received some percentage of the vote in the preceding election often automatically gets ballot access. The intent is to ensure that only serious candidates get on the ballot. Allowing large numbers of frivolous candidates would confuse voters, and increase the chance that the first-past-the-post system elects an undesired candidate (by splitting the vote between similar candidates). (Consider comedian Stephen Colbert's candidacy in 2008; he was denied primary ballot access because his candidacy was deemed to be a joke.) A candidate/party that lacks ballot access can still be elected by write-in votes, but many states require write-in candidates to submit forms first. A bizarre case where the ballot-access rules went wrong was a Tennessee State Senate election in 1998, in which candidate Byron Looper removed his only opponent from the ballot by assassinating him (Tennessee law denied ballot access to deceased people). It is worth noting that some states even provide ballot access to constitutionally ineligible candidates that meet the state requirements. For example, for the 2012 election, the Party for Socialism and Liberation nominated a 28-year-old and a foreign-born citizen for President and Vice President, but the ticket nevertheless obtained ballot access in nine states."
545,Are state laws restricting electors' votes constitutional?,NEGATIVE,"Several states have laws that purport to restrict or punish faithless electors for their electoral votes. See Wikipedia's Faithless elector: Legal position. Michigan and Minnesota even claim the authority to replace the votes of faithless electors after the fact: If an elector fails to cast a ballot for the presidential or vice presidential candidate of the party under whose name the elector was chosen, the elector's vote or abstention is invalidated and an alternate presidential elector, chosen by lot from among the alternates, shall cast a ballot in the name of the elector for the presidential and vice presidential candidate of the party under whose name the elector was chosen. If the status of elector is viewed literally, such laws constitute interference with the elector's free franchise. This obviously seems legally suspect. While faithless-elector laws have never been enforced, and thus have not been tested in court, are they legally valid? (This is separate of the issue of whether states or parties can require electors to pledge to vote for their party's candidate—which they can.)"
546,Does lowering the capital gains tax encourage investment and increase economic growth?,NEGATIVE,Capital gains are taxed lower than other types of incomes in several nations.The rationale I have heard for this is that a lower tax on capital gains is supposed to encourage investment and increase the economic growth. Is there any hard data on whether this effect exists and how large it is?
547,"",NEGATIVE,"There is a pretty in-depth paper written in 2010 by the widely respected and non-partisan Congressional Research Service (which is part of the Library of Congress) here. TL;DR Version - No, there is no real effect on the economy as a whole from changes in capital gains tax rates. If there were, it potentially could be inverse (lowering taxes hurts growth). A quick summary of points from the paper: Higher capital gains (CG) tax rates discourage realizations (selling off the stock) but not necessarily investment. This generally makes the markets less efficient as normal selling behavior is inhibited. This behavior has been observed at the macro level. There is an associated argument that lowering rates actually increases the revenue, since the observed rate of decrease in realization is higher than the increase in the rate - i.e. there could be a \"sweet spot\" of moderate tax rate but high realizations There is a counterargument to the above that the increases in CG tax may be offset by reductions in other tax revenues as investors shift assets to the lowest tax-burdened vehicle There is little evidence to support the argument that lower rates increase high-risk investment - in 2003 only 10% of venture capital investors were non-institutional \"...[C]apital gains tax rate reductions are unlikely to have much effect on the long-term level of output...\" - long term economic growth is unaffected one way or the other by CG rates within their historical bands \"A tax reduction on capital gains would mostly benefit very high income taxpayers who are likely to save most of any tax reduction...\" - There's no evidence that CG tax decreases stimulate short term growth either, since short term growth requires increased demand. Some economists suggest a short-term CG tax decrease could hurt short term growth since it adds incentive to sell stock but not to buy again, reducing the capital pool available for investment."
548,"",NEGATIVE,"What is available from the historical record seems to indicate that in fact capital gains being taxed at a lower rate than average income has no statistically significant impact on the economy at large. From a recent Business Week article's analysis of a recent Congressional hearing on the matter: Leonard Burman, who teaches economics at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, presented a graph at the joint hearing that plotted capital gains tax rates against economic growth from 1950 to 2011. He found no statistically significant correlation between the two. This was true even if Burman built in lag times of five years. After several economists took him up on an offer to share his data, none came back having discovered a historical relationship between the rates and growth over those six decades. In fact, the idea that the capital gains tax should be lower than the income tax rate in order to spur investment is itself a novel idea that hasn't even been around that long. When Ronald Reagan lowered the top income tax bracket's rate from 50% to 28%, he also raised the capital gains tax rate to 28%. From the same article, we see that Reagan wanted the entire tax package to be revenue-neutral, \"and bumping up the capital gains rate seemed an easy way to raise money.\" In more recent times, the Simpson-Bowles came to the same conclusion and argued that the income tax and capital gains tax rates should move in tandem."
549,"",NEGATIVE,"As you indicate, we will ultimately need to wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in on such a question, but some analysis of our own can lead to a reasonable understanding of the argument that might be made. First, the only the thing that the Constitution actually says about the selection and voting of the state's electors is the following in Article II, Section 1, Clause 2: Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector. The key point of this statement is that the electors shall be appointed in a manner the state's legislature deems fit, not by some national or Constitutional standard. As a result, many of the types of laws you highlight are going to be given a fair bit of leniency from the Supreme Court. In fact, almost all election law in the United States is state law and that is why we see elections being carried out so differently from state to state with the state's Secretary of State presiding over and certifying elections."
550,Prohibition on incestual marriage vs same sex marriage - what does the data say?,NEGATIVE,"Two of the related arguments made by people who oppose same-sex marriage (especially those who do it on the basis of \"marriage is for raising kids\"): The slippery slope argument. Usually goes \"if you let two guys marry, why not 2 siblings?\" A similar but opposite direction policy argument: \"You claim to support same sex marriage because the government can not treat people differently by saying who they can't marry. But you yourself support government telling people that they can't marry, e.g. between siblings\". The problem is that such arguments are based on unsupported assumption that there are indeed people who support one and not the other. Thus, I have a couple of sub-questions: How valid is that assumption? What I seek as an answer is a comparison of polls/surveys which show support for same-sex marriage vs polls that show opinion about sibling marriage. It's probably too much to ask for a poll asking the 2 from the same people, but that would be ideal. If there are indeed statistically significant amount of people who support same sex marriage but oppose letting siblings marry - based on the first question - what are their main arguments for why there are differences between the two situations (legally, ethically or practically)? I would prefer this to be ideally somehow referenced (e.g. a policy paper, a speech, or at least a blog post articulating the position). Please note that I am not asking for the overall reasons why people oppose incestual marriage - those are obvious and well documented (Rooted in Old Testament and then Christian marriage laws, and more likely than not arising out of genetics issues arising from children of incest). Also, I am explicitly excluding inter-generational incest, since a rational argument can be made against it based on unequal power distribution."

Total GDP is higher than in 2007 but that doesn't tie directly to personal income, and there would still be a $100B deficit at 2007 levels. Another interesting point from these numbers is that the last year a 100% tax on income over $1m would have balanced the budget was 2007, when the deficit was around $160B."

555,"",NEGATIVE,"Without speaking to the merits of a particular law, one way that we can judge the success of a state sponsored initiative as a model for the country is the degree to which it is independently adopted (i.e. copied) by other states. Presumably, if a state seeks to copy and bring in another state's law to govern it's own citizens, then a majority of the elected representatives in that state see the law as having been a success. To that end, I think you have to say that the \"laboratories of democracy\" concept that Justice Brandeis spoke of is in itself a successful model for the country based on the sheer volume of examples that exist. Just in the 2012 elections we saw several states (Maryland, Washington and Maine) vote to adopt same sex marriage laws, presumably based on what their electorate saw as successes in other states around the country. Similarly, the last several election cycles have seen the pioneers of medical marijuana (California notably) spreading similar laws across the country. Washington and Colorado even taking it a step further and exploring recreational marijuana use in their states. Perhaps other states will see success in these laws in the future and adopt them for themselves, or potentially they will fizzle and be repealed or at least spread no further. Without going into a laundry list of all the different examples, I also found a smattering of articles speaking to this same point on issues ranging from education, to immigration and union rights which you can look at below.

It is accepted that citizens of the United States (including native-born citizens, and persons that hold only U.S. citizenship) are allowed to renounce their citizenship. For example, Facebook executive Eduardo Saverin recently renounced his U.S. citizenship (leaving him with only Brazilian citizenship). The Expatriation Act of 1868 (enacted less than a month after the 14th amendment was promulgated), said in part: Be it enacted[...], That any declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officers of this government which restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation, is hereby declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this government. But this seems to contradict the plain reading of the Citizenship Clause, which appears to state that citizens are citizens regardless of whether they purport to have renounced their citizenship.

562,"How is a political party radicalised, and what are the effects?",VERY_NEGATIVE,"In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the British Labour Party was seen by many as having retreated from the centre ground of British politics into an obsession with left-wing ideological purity. In 1981, a significant number of centrist members left to join the breakaway SDP, pushing the balance of the party's remaining membership further to the left by default. At the same time, a Trotskyist group called Militant was alleged to have been using entryist tactics to expand its influence within the party. Labour's 1983 manifesto1, popularly known as \"The longest suicide note in history\", was an unusually detailed document, containing many policy positions considered radically outside the mainstream of popular opinion at the time, and expressed in language which appealed more to the hard left than the general public. Labour suffered a massive electoral defeat in 1983, partly as a result of votes lost to the SDP, and conventional wisdom in the UK holds that its return to electability was won only as a result of its shift during the late 1980s and early 1990s to a more centrist position (which, among other things, involved the expulsion of many known and suspected Militant members from the party). I'd like to know: Is there a name for the phenomenon of a movement or party accelerating away from the mainstream as \"moderate\" supporters leave and previously \"fringe\"2 elements seek to gain influence? I've used \"radicalised\" in the title of this question, but it seems insufficient. Is the phenomenon always, or even usually, associated with a loss of wider political influence, as would seem logical (since fewer voters will identify with a less mainstream set of policies)? To what extent could it be argued that the Tea Party in the US is a Libertarian version of an entryist group in the mould of Militant? 1 Labour Party Manifesto, 1983 2 This is not intended as a pejorative; if there's a better word I didn't think of, I'd be interested to hear it."
563,"",NEGATIVE,"I'm not yet able to answer if the phenomenon has an official PoliSci name. I would argue that such an outcome is not guaranteed. Presumably, Hitler's policies were not exactly mainstream in the early 1930s yet Nazi popularity grew instead of shrinking. This had more to do with the ability of ideas and policies to attract popular support where they had none before, turning them into \"mainstream\". Same can be said of progressives in USA, although here the example works to both sides of your question. A large chunk of their actual policies were not nearly mainstream for most of USA's history, yet the same exact policies produced both Walter Mondale's 525/13 electoral loss to Reagan in 1984 (interestingly tempered by the fact that, while losing 49 states out of 50, he still managed to harvest 40% of national popular vote vs Reagan's 59%). But, after the same policies attracted more support, Obama's 2008 365/173 EV win over McCain (53%/45% popular vote split) became possible. Of course, both cases were not helped by the fact that Reagan was a super talented politician and McCain ... I suppose saying \"sucked\" would be too subjective for StackExchange, but he did - the whole suspending campaign due to financial crisis being the most glaring example. The main factors affecting whether such a radicalization helps or hurts seem to be: A. having an extremely skillful populist politician at the helm (Hitler was universally regarded as an extremely effective orator, and Mein Kampf is written in a highly convincing style). B. Having unique set of circumstances where a combination of environmental changes (demographics, economy) makes the opposition greatly unpopular and your own policies appear to have effective - at least short term - fixes. Hitler would have been a footnote of history if not for Germany's internal issues in the wake of Versailles treaty. Obama was greatly helped by both unpopularity of Iraq war, Bush's political ineptitude, and financial crisis (pre-crisis, McCains polls were on par or better, if I recall); as well as dramatically shifting demographics of the country. Numbers say that Tea Party is nowhere near \"extreme\"/\"radicalized\" as mass media paint them. Therefore they can't be equated to entryist Trotskists, I would argue. Recall that their main political positions are balancing the budget via reducing federal spending and not increasing taxes; and as a specific policy example of this trend, objections to Obamacare. Let's see how that sits with American people as far as being \"extreme\": Obamacare: 2012/11/18 Gallup poll found that 54% think that is NOT the business of government to ensure that everyone has healthcare, vs 44% approve: A separate Dec 2012 CNN poll found that Obamacare is opposed/supported by 52%/42%. Balancing the budget via spending vs. taxes: According to this 2012/12/11 poll (yadd yadda, Faux Evil News - except the poll was conducted by a joint R and D affiliated companies, as live phone interviews, and included cell phones which as per Nate Silver is supposed to be the main methodological deficiency between good and bad polls last year): \"Which do you think is the BEST way to deal with the country’s budget problems?\" 57%: Mostly with cuts in government spending 20%: Mostly with tax increases 18%: Both (Both) (Other) 5%: Other/Don't know \"Do you think raising taxes on the wealthy can solve the country’s budget problems -- or do you think major spending cuts are necessary also?\" 61%: No, major spending cuts are necessary also 33%: Yes, raising taxes on wealthy can solve budget problems Please note that the numbers above are from overall population, if you only break out Republicans, they are even higher. Beneson Survey of Obama voters (on behalf of a Democratic think tank!) found that: 41% who supported the Democratic incumbent want to get control of the deficit mostly by cutting spending, with only some tax increases, another 41% want to solve it mostly with tax increases and only some spending cuts Hardly a sign of \"extremism\" when 41% of opposing party agrees with you on the main point. Now, it is true some Tea Party candidates were defeated in 2012. However, very few had anything to do solely with \"extreme\" Tea Party views. Two of the most infamous defeats were because the candidates stopped running on Tea Party fiscal platform and decided to open their idiot mouths and start running as religious conservatives, which was precisely what Tea Party platform was NOT about, and several narrowly lost due to coattail effects from Obama's ticket). Even so, Republicans retained a solid majority of the House (lost between 6 and 12 seats, this seems to be inconsistent) lost only 2 seats in the Senate wound up BETTER against Obama than McCain in 2008 (332/206 vs 2008 365/173 EVs, and 51%/47% vs 2008 53%/45% popular vote)"

Why is that? More info on Italy's complex electoral laws"
568,"",NEGATIVE,"In Italy, the electoral system can be changed with the majority of the Lower and Upper houses. The current electoral system called by Giovanni Sartori \"Porcellum\" gives the majority (and a bonus of elected, \"premio di maggioranza\") to a coalition of parties, not to a single party, so small parties can survive. Some parties of those are present only in some territories. Post-war Italy hadn't a pure majority electoral system, the current one is proportional and the previous (Mattarellum) was a mix (75% majority, 25% proportional). During last 10 years, only two parties become strong enough (more than 20%) to lead coalitions: PDL (center-right) and PD (center-left). So, why there are too many parties? Electoral system can be changed by majority: if a party knows it'll lost next elections, it can change the law to limit the opponent. No real majority electoral system was adopted in Italy after WWII. Highly polarized electorate. No serious election threshold for parties was adopted to correct fragmentation by proportional system. In the Italian edition of Comparative Constitutional Engineering (Ingegneria costituzionale comparata) Sartori describes these problems very well, and many times he cites Germany (proportional system with per-party election threesold) as an example to follow."
569,"",NEGATIVE,"While there are very obvious reasons why a single-member district, first-past-the-post system would prevent a third party from emerging in a locale with 2 dominant parties [1], it's not at all obvious that such a dynamic would force an existing multi-party system to collapse to dual-party one, especially if there are mitigating factors (discussed below) The Wiki link you provided indicates that currently, Italy has a mix of single-member districts AND (smaller) proportional representation system. The latter obviously gives additional anchoring to multiple parties. Also, while there are many distinct parties, many of them are purely regional. Italy seems to have an extremely wide variety of political viewpoints. The parties range from recently-disbanded \"neo-fascist\" Italian Social Movement to Communists and Socialists of various stripes to liberals of all kinds. This may promote multi-party system While there are many parties, usually they unite into 2 main coalitions (center-left and center-right). [1] - The usual simple reason is that voting for a less popular but strongly preferred third party simply means that you just deprived one of the two mainstream candidates of your vote (and decreased the chances of winning for the party you prefer more among the two for no gain)."
570,What is the rationale behind having different voting ages?,NEGATIVE,In some countries you can vote for one arm of the parliament at one age (say 18 years) and for the other at a different age (say 25). Is there a rationale or is it merely tradition? For example this happens in Italy.
571,When is legalization a better alternative?,NEGATIVE,"While prohibition never worked with alcohol, and legalization of soft drugs seeming more and more acceptable to the general public, there are clearly plenty of examples of cases in which prohibition works. For example, it's illegal to steal and I don't think there is any strong support for the legalization of stealing... or to make a different and less extreme example, there is little support for the legalization of driving under the influence. What is the difference between legalizing a drug and legalizing a different criminal behaviour? Why is the former considered better than prohibition but not so the second?"
572,What socio-economic measurement system may become an alternative to the economic growth percentage?,NEGATIVE,"I live in Israel where the government constantly brags about a high economic growth percentage, while many claim that this datum isn't sufficient for describing the true nature of the socio-economic situation. Those people would suggest that a better way of measurement must be introduced, where there will be a proper representation for different well-fare elements, distribution of wealth, etc. The Gini coefficient for example is not good as an alternative, as it does not intend to reflect the economic growth of a country along with the equality situation. What more progressive measurement system might be used in order to show both the economic growth AND the actual socio-economic experience of people of a different socio-economic status (not only the 'average')? I'm looking for something that may be simplified and described in numbers, so the general public, without professional economical knowledge, will have a simple tool of measurement for the functionality of the government."
573,"",NEGATIVE,"As far as Italy, it seems to be merely tradition (but short lived one, as the current voting laws were established in 1946). I base this answer on the fact that they are, in fact, changing the 25 YO limit: (ANSA) - Rome, July 18 - Italy is set to lower the minimum age for people to become Senators and to vote for representatives in the Upper House. On Wednesday the Senate approved an article contained in constitutional reforms that will allow for Senators to be as young as 35, down from the current minimum age of 40. The voting age will be 18 for both the House and the Senate - at the moment a voters had to be 25 before casting a ballot in Senate elections. (src: http://www.lifeinitaly.com/news/en/154224) Now, as to the 'why', I was not able to find any officially stated reasons, but one can speculate on the obvious: All voting age restrictions are based on perceived ability to make 'wise' voting decisions. Since typically, upper parlament chambers are elected for longer periods of time, AND are meant to 'temper' popular vote based lower chambers (e.g. in USA, the Founders meant for House to be representing the People, and the Senate, the States); it may have been felt that Italian upper house should have 'wiser' people electing them. Italy does have an electoral tradition of restricting franchise, for example: The Sardinian Statuto Albertino of 1848, extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, provided for basic freedoms, but the electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting.

574,"",NEGATIVE,"There are four main reasons people support legalization of drugs but not other behavior: Many people feel that drugs are \"victimless\" behavior, and as such, are not a crime An interesting analogy would be that it's not a crime to gamble away one's money, if you are comparing stealing material property to drugs; state lotteries are legal even in places that supposedly prohibit gambling. Please note that there is a (smaller) group of people who are very nuanced about this: they wish to combine legalizing the consumption of drugs itself, BUT at the same time, strongly increase penalties for any other crimes or even misdemeanours that may endanger other people, such as DUI ( my own personal proposal would be to exchange legalizing drugs for declaring DUI to be fully legally treated as attempted murder and any victims resulting from DUI as premeditated actual/attempted murder). Second reason is purely practical. Prohibition Just Doesn't Work. Period. It doesn't matter why, but it's been proven repeatedly that it does not. Prohibiting a random crime X usually works to stop it from happening in most cases (e.g. stealing). Prohibiting addictive substance consumption does NOT. To quote an famous adage (I heard it attributed to Swedish King Gustav Adolf), \"don't pass laws you can not enforce\". In other words, it doesn't matter if the law has a good rationale - if you can not enforce it, you merely sabotage the legitimacy of the government, to no good end. The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the Prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this. – Albert Einstein It is well known that prohibition of addictive substances in practice usually leads to increased crime and strengthening of organized criminal organization, especially in democracies. Prohibition is what allowed American gangsters to flourish; drug laws is what allowed drug cartels AND gangs to flourish in the second half of 20th century. This is fairly obvious - when you prohibit something, you drive up the price, especially if it's an addictive substance which ensures unceasing demand. Since the substance is prohibited, you also dramatically decrease the pool of suppliers, providing those suppliers with a lot of funding. And, since it's illegal, your suppliers will not simply be criminals, but usually the worst ones (due to lucrativity) and the most ruthless and well organized ones. Ergo, you just took your worst criminal organization and handed them what is in essence an unlimited source of funding and unlimited reason to use violence to protect that source. This one is just a corollary of #1/#2/#3 - legalizing drugs brings fiscal and economic benefits to the state where prohibition does the opposite. The argument, on the surface, is fairly simple cost-benefit analysis: Prohibition: Your costs include the loss of taxes on an economic activity that is driven underground; the economic losses of extra-high costs going abroad; the costs of law enforcement/judiciary; the costs of incarceration; the economic losses on having productive population incarcerated; and the second effect costs of strengthened organized crime. Legalization: You have the economic costs of addicted people who can't participate in the economy and have to be treated (but many of those people are just as afflicted under Prohibition); you have economic costs of people hurting other people while under the influence such as DUI (but as noted above, that can be easily addressed by enhanced anti-DUI legislation)."
576,Where one can find the data on Shorrocks index for the world?,NEGATIVE,"Shorrocks index is an index of estimated income mobility (in other words, how likely is it for someone who was in bottom 20% by income in their country to increase their income in N years to move to other income quartiles than bottom 20%). I tried googling, but didn't see any obvious sources of actual index results for countries of the world. Is there a good source of that data?"
577,Why do party's candidature requirements exist in some countries?,NEGATIVE,"The Republic by the Spanish Wikipedia is: Republic (from latin res publica, «the politic, the public»), in a wide sense, is a politic system based on the law's empire, the law ( the constitution) and the equality before the law as a way to stop the possible power abuses of the rulers, the government or the majorities, with the objective to protect the fundamental rights and the civil liberties. If in theory all the citizens are equal before the law, having same rights, they should have the same chance to become a candidate for any government position as governor or president for example. Then: Why some Republics request to their citizens for a party's support, a huge signature list or money to become a candidate?"
578,"",NEGATIVE,"DVK's answer is really great but too focused for this question, I think, so I'd like to add this more general statement, which I feel it better addresses the question itself. You are comparing two completely different things. Drinking alcohol or using drugs doesn't directly harm anyone other than yourself. It may cause you to commit other crimes, but those are things which already are crimes anyway. Stealing, on the other hand, harms the original owner of the stolen object, since he doesn't have that object any more. Hence, it is perfectly logic to never ban actions which don't directly damage other people, while keeping banning those who do."
579,"",NEGATIVE,"This is a means of keeping radical fringe parties from inadvertently gaining power. Germany, for example, requires all parties to have at least 5% of the vote in order to have seats in parliament. Prior to the Nazis taking over, they were a minority party who coopted many fringe parties into a coalition from which they then launched into dictatorship. Many of the smallest parties are single issue ones that can be used in such a way, so some countries ban the smallest ones in order to prevent this from happening again. Ballots are confusing enough for some people (Witness Florida!). By limiting ballot access to complete fringe parties, the ballot can be more easily understood by, say, the illiterate or the uninformed. At least in the United States, literacy tests are barred by Constitutional Amendment. Generally speaking, there is public good in having a limited number of choices (usually in Virginia we have about 6, rather than say, 600). Not only is there a cost to printing such a ballot, but there is also a cost in reading it."
580,What is the Overton window?,NEGATIVE,"I have heard of the Overton Window on Wikipedia and in a question on Skeptics StackExchange. Wikpedia says: The Overton window is a political theory that describes as a narrow \"window\" the range of ideas that the public will find acceptable, and that states that the political viability of an idea is defined primarily by this rather than by politicians' individual preferences. I have three questions here: Can you explain this concept a bit better? Is this a hypothesis or a proven theory? If so, can you give an example of the Overton Window in action?"
581,Why do political bodies often sit in semicircles?,NEGATIVE,"It is quite common for legislative bodies to sit in \"semi circles\". source I can see how, for historical reasons, this shape was optimal for hearing clearly in a large room, however this needs not be so in the present day and age. This \"strip-like\" configuration arguably also lead to the concept of left and right and of two political \"poles\". Why, then, do we keep on using this seating structure? Are there any countries that experimented with different seating shapes and with what results?"
582,"",NEGATIVE,"The answer is very short but the reasons are: In theory when a speaker reads his speeches on the tribune, the speaker represents a portion of the \"people\", and because of that He deserves respect from his colleagues (other speakers), so a good way to do that is pointing all the seats in direction to the tribune. The acoustic reason, is because they try to imitate or simulate a the Greek Theater, where the sound is distributed uniformly along all the seats and the last user (in this case another speaker) can listen what the other speaker says. Don't forget that most of speakers Houses were built in XIX Century when the microphone didn't exist, so listening to others was troublesome. ---------------------------------_______________________________________"
583,"",NEGATIVE,"First off, Overton Window is neither a hypothesis nor a proven theory. It's an attempt to label an existing observed phenomenon. There are 2 ways to think of Overton window: You can think of Overton windows as a spectrum of ideas, with each idea on a spectrum having more and more support/political acceptance; till you get to the level of idea being an official government policy; and then further up the spectrum less and less support again. Let's look at the usual example (based on the post by the person who first popularized the concept, Joshua Trevino): Education policy. In a typical state, say Michigan, there are a variety of options regarding the State's involvement in children's education. Each option has a certain level of popular support, which are roughly grouped into 6 bands: Unthinkable/Radical/Acceptable/Sensible/Popular/Policy. The last band is the level of acceptance which is high enough that the government can implement the idea as policy. The point made by Overton (aside from the bands) is that usually, a very narrow range of ideas on the spectrum have political acceptance. +================+=========================================================+ | Acceptability | Idea | | Level | | +================+=========================================================+ | Unthinkable | No government involvement in education. | | Radical | All schools private with government regulation. | | Radical | Voucher system with public schools. | | Radical | Tuition tax credit with public schools. | | Acceptable | Homeschooling legal. | | Popular/Policy | Private schools restricted. | | Acceptable | Homeschooling illegal. | | Radical | Private schools illegal. | | Unthinkable | Children taken from parents and raised as janissaries. | +================+=========================================================+ You can also simply think of it as a graph of what % of people's support is required if we want to achieve a certain level of political acceptance: It may help if we show a graph and a table Here's my own graph (please note that the #s are made up - I'm not aware that Overton meant specific #s, or that mine are even remotely accurate. Apologies for somewhat unparallel lines - making graphs by hand in Paint.NET is not the best idea ever :) In the graph, the Blue letters are the Overton Acceptability scale, and they are graphed against the % of population which should support the idea before it reaches that level acceptability. Here's that graph in a table form: +===+===============+===========+==============================================+ | | Acceptability | % popular | | | | Level | support | Comment | +===+===============+===========+==============================================+ | U | Unthinkable | &lt; 1% | Not 0, some wackos always like ANY idea :) | | R | Radical | 10% | Some # | | A | Acceptable | 25-30% | Majority of one political party supports | | S | Sensible | 40% | Independents start liking it | | P | Popular | 53% | A majority outside margin of error. | | Po| Policy | 60%+ | Because filibuster | +===+===============+===========+==============================================+ To re-iterate, the actual percentages in the table are made up by me based on some well-reasoned logic, not actual numbers proposed by Overton (he didn't propose any) or formally proven by science. I just feel that having actual numeric estimates illustrates the idea better. Please note that there is a related concept that sometimes gets confused with \"Overton Window\" - and that is \"moving Overton Window\". The idea is pretty simple: if we look at the spectrum, and the idea we like is NOT within \"Acceptable\" range right now, we want to do something to make the Overton window move in the range, so our idea is going to be acceptable. Or in reverse, to make the window move so an idea we oppose but is currently acceptable becomes Un-acceptable. (e.g. Radical/Unthinkable). For example, in 19th century, the idea of owning slaves was quite acceptable, and was a policy. The goal of the Abolitionist movement was to move the Overton window so that the idea became unacceptable to majority of population. Or take drug legalization. In 19th century, it was quite acceptable to take recreational/medicinal drugs. Later, the Overton window moved so that it became unthinkable/radical for drugs to be legal. Then the hippies made the idea of legal drugs acceptable, or at lease sensible in the 60s; and libertarians moved it from acceptable to at least popular, and with some states legalizing it, to Policy. And further, another notion that gets confused, is a very specific method for moving the Overton Window (as discussed above) by openly proposing Radical/Unthinkable ideas into popular conversation; with the effect that less radical but unpopular ideas further up the spectrum become Acceptable or Sensible. Now, I have a feeling that in your bullet point questions you were actually referring to this specific concept and not to an actual static Overton Window I defined above, based on the Skeptics link. As such, the fact that this method works is not really a proven theory, and more of an observation of how the human decision making works. It's not even specific to politics, the same exact psychological concept works for example in business: You need to convince your boss to use approach X to solve a problem You favor a solution Y that's not very acceptable to the boss at the moment. Instead of proposing Y, you propose 3 distinct solutions, \"Y, the bad, and the ugly\" The boss is more likely to agree to Y, after seeing the awfulness of the other two solutions. Why? By comparison, the negatives of solution Y seem insignificant (this is called the decoy effect). By being able to reject the 2 bad solutions, you \"sate\" the boss's need to \"perform managerial functions\" (aka \"I gotta provide some criticism here\"). This isn't necessary with good bosses, and totally useless with either great (already has a correct vision/solution) or poor (already has A vision/solution, not necessarily correct, and not willing to stop micromanaging :) As an example, take a look at the healthcare discussion in the USA. This is very instructive because it was exactly the topic discussed in the DailyKos article I linked to in the very beginning, where the authors - in 2006 - proposed that using this method of moving the Overton window is desirable for Progressives overall and used healthcare in partucular. Before, the concepts of fully nationalized healthcare, single-payer system, requiring everyone to have health insurance, and forcing people to pay for other perople's health insurance via a tax were... not very popular shall we say. Witness Hillarycare and its failure's subsequent negative effects on Clinton and DNC. As David Atkins advocated in the DailyKos article, the progressives, instead of running scared from the single-payer idea, should have used it to drive the changes in Overton window. Which is exactly what happened. When Obama administration and liberal Congress of 2008 started discussing single-payer system and how NHS is great, the idea of requiring everyone to have insurance and have taxpayers foot the bill all over the sudden became \"acceptable\" and reached 40% popularity, even if it never reached the \"popular\" Overton status (current polls have Americans reject the idea 54% vs 44%, despite it having already become \"policy\")."
584,Why didn't Americans Elect field a candidate in the 2012 U.S. presidential election?,NEGATIVE,"Americans Elect was trying to get an alternative candidate on the ballot in the 2012 presidential election. The party was to hold a completely online convention to elect a party ticket to run. However, the party ended up not fielding a candidate and not showing up on the ballot. What was the reason that no ticket was put forth and what factors most contributed to that result?"
585,"",NEGATIVE,"As one who regularly addresses large crowds, I can tell you that while acoustics may not be as important today, eye contact still is. Alternatives such as a podium in the round are disconcerting at best. Also, remember that many legislatures in the United States are in the same buildings they have been in for years. Tradition plays an important role, and there is a high bar to change it. Finally, if you are wondering why parties sit together, there is an even simpler reason. Think back to high school. Given a choice between assigned seats (where the teacher decided) and sitting with your friends, which did you choose? In most assemblies, the podium is one of the less interesting things going on. It's the ability to talk with your colleagues (the polite term is caucus), both for strategic reasons and just because you like them better that matters."
586,Do/did non-dictatorial Communist societies exist?,NEGATIVE,"I've often heard the following two points of view: Communism is a failed philosophy, and it has always failed (e.g. USSR, China, Cuba etc...). Therefore it's simply wrong. Communism has never been applied correctly, but that's for historical reasons and not intrinsic to communism. Therefore it's basically misunderstood. Are there examples of societies adopting Communism (or Marxism) and thriving without degenerating in dictatorial Soviet-style societies? As a side note: are there good treaties on the subject which are not partisan but strive to give an objective overview of the matter?"
587,"",NEGATIVE,"Presidential elections start at least two years in advance of the election. Americans Elect started in February 2012 with their nominating process. Without sufficient lead-time, it is impossible to generate sufficient mass (momentum and money) to get a candidate to move forward. The sign-on process to get a delegate officially listed took anywhere from 20 minutes to two days, in Internet time, this is a life-time. Candidates had to go find their own delegates to build a base which required them to find them through mobile vans with computers to sign them up. The cost for each supporter would be about 5 times the cost for the Republicans or Democrats to get ballot signatures. A serious candidate would need $5 million to get nominated on Americans Elect. If one were going to spend $5 million to get on the Americans Elect ballot, one could simply do it themselves without the baggage of Americans Elect because after the nominating process, Americans Elect was not supporting the candidate after the election. The Americans Elect board demanded a centrist candidate from each party instead of one from the left and one from the right. This created a false impression that the board would not approve candidates that did not meet their criteria."
588,"",NEGATIVE,"A political party (and any organisation that seeks to field candidates for office is a political party, whether it claims otherwise or not) needs two things: Money. Footsoldiers. The founder of AE, Peter Ackerman, seems to have an ample supply of the former - he made over $300 million as a director at the junk bond trading firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, before the company filed for bankruptcy in the wake of a securities fraud investigation, and his disputes with the IRS over $150 million in allegedly unpaid taxes suggest that he's at least as wealthy in recent times as he was at the collapse of Drexel. It's in the second category, footsoldiers, that AE seems to have been lacking. The AE website is, at this point, little more than a holding page, but at the time of AE's withdrawal from the 2012 presidential race, its effort to find a presidential candidate with widespread support had been singularly unsuccessful: source: Daily Kos This is not, to be honest, surprising. People who decide to invest their time and energy in causes do so because they are passionate about them, and AE's founding principle - that politics in the US is too partisan and polarized - may not be particularly inspiring to such people; few are passionate about being somewhere in the middle. AE did, however find one candidate to support for election: Angus King, who was subsequently elected as Senator for Maine. A complaint about alleged irregularities in AE's support for King was filed with the FEC by the Republican Party of Maine as a result of this support."
590,Do dog-whistle politics only refer to racist and right-leaning statements?,NEGATIVE,"I don't think I have ever heard the term applied to statements on the left. Supposedly racists can understand a hidden meaning or applied to the Christian right, but the majority of voters cannot hear when certain phrases are used. She uses as an example Australian politicians using broadly-appealing words such as 'family' and 'values' which have extra resonance for Christians, while avoiding overt Christian moralizing that might be a turn-off for non-Christian voters. The phrase 'states' rights', although literally referring to powers of individual state governments in the United States, was described by David Greenberg in Slate as 'code words' for institutionalized segregation and racism. Are any words from the left considered dog-whistle politics phrases. For example, are the following considered code words?: Social Justice: Code word for wealth redistribution. Sustainability: Code word for reductions in developed nations standard of living, decreased meat consumption, and ecotaxes. Diversity: Code word for promotion of non-white people and cultures, racial quotas, affirmative action."
591,"What will it take for a \"Third Party\" to gain REAL traction at any level in the United States?",NEGATIVE,"I've been around long enough to be registered to and somewhat involved with a number of so-called \"third party\" efforts. These include the Libertarian, Peace and Freedom, Green and my very favorite defunct effort the Natural Law Party. The Greens and Libertarians have been around for at least 30 years and have NEVER expanded beyond their base of die-hard supporters. What do you think it will take for a new political party to break through and actually gain traction at the municipal, state or national levels?"
592,"",NEGATIVE,"The reason that \"dog whistle\" is only used by progressives to apply to their opponents is because that term was invented (in a political usage) by progressives. But yes, in all fairness, the examples provided are no different conceptually if you consider the defined Wiki usage (political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup). As a matter of fact, most terms used by progressives in political discourse have hidden connotations that aren't at all obvious to someone who merely knows regular English: UPDATE And in case my own answer seems \"too biased\" as source of examples, how about Obama's Secretary of Treasury Time Geitner, who in his memoir quotes Obama's White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer: \"It wasn't a main driver of our future deficits, but it did contribute,\" Geithner wrote, explaining his own reasoning. \"Pfeiffer said the line was a 'dog whistle' to the left, a phrase I had never heard before. He had to explain that the phrase was code to the Democratic base, signalling that we intended to protect Social Security.\" Minority: a normal person (let's take an immigrant from a country who has English fluency but never heard modern progressive political discourse as a yardstick) would assume it's a group/demographics that is a small % of general population. To progressives, it means preferred \"oppressed\"/\"victim\" demographics that needs special privileges even if in numerical majority. \"Working class\": Does not, for some reason, mean \"all people who work\". This basically means \"anyone who should in our opinion be against evil capitalism and for us\" to the target audience; and the usual implied set of people doesn't fit any objective definition. The definition from common language usage - e.g. \"people who work\" doesn't match (since progressive's context always includes people on welfare, including those who didn't work a single day of their life). None of the \"official\" definitions given by Progressives match either: \"People who are poor\" - Nope. Progressive context include union members many of whom have a total compensation package (per-hour salary, gold-plated benefits, super generous pension with early retirement, and guaranteed job security) that exceeds typical middle-class white collar employee, or even most entrepreneurs who aren't yet super successful. \"People who do physical work\" - Nope. This excludes any white collar professionals who do physical work as part of their occupation, e.g. surgeons; and includes people like subway train operators, whose job is (no disrespect) to sit in a chair all day and press a couple of buttons once every couple of minutes (a lot less physical work than most bankers do, by any objective standard). \"People deriving their living through wages as opposed to investments\" - this excludes \"working class\" retirees whose income is 100% from ... *gasp*... investments."
593,"",NEGATIVE,"Both of your bullet points are correct, and both are wrong. Yes, communism was actually successfully applied. The caveats are that it was only successful under the following limitations: in an extremely small scale (either geographically - think a single village - e.g. Kibbutzes in Israel are, for all intents and purposes, an example of Communism in action; or professionally - think FOSS and/or FSF as contained systems). Some less \"standard\" examples would be theology-based communes, from early Christians to late new-age hippies. in an society which is a part of a larger society - by which I mean that said communist small scale implementation has access to larger demographics (allowing them to draw in fresh members who aren't yet disenchanted with the idea/practice AND to outplace those in the community who are disenchanted; as well as shed excess children so you don't have to grow significantly if your birth/survival rate exceeds 2.1). In an open economic system. For example, Kibbutzes or hippie communies in California don't need to spend money on R&amp;D in agriculture, or defense, or large scale law enforcement (again, you may have the luxury to exclude 1-3% of psychopaths/sociopaths from a small community, and not worry about said excluded psychopaths attacking you for your communal material possessions from outside since they are dealt with by outside society), or on disaster preparedness, or on medical R&amp;D, or pretty much any other economic overhead of modern civilization. Possessed economy and quality of life above subsistence-level farming, and did not depend on unusually rich natural resources. For example, presumably, you could have a communist community in an area with unlimited energy-rich wild life and vegetation, warm, stable climate and natural places to live such as caves. Basically, where you don't actually need industry or production to live reasonably well). No, there was never a successful attempt to implement communism on large scale (a country with 10+ million population, modern infrastructure, and not dependent in large part on external aid in variety of forms). Every time it was attempted, it failed to get to the communist stage, because communism as an idea is very attractive in theory yet in practice incompatible with actual human nature. The main problems of communism without an accompanying authoritarian political regime include: Lack of incentives. Human greed. We evolved this way, so no amount of education will drive it out. In general, Maslow's hierarchy of needs leads to inherent inequalities because their satisfaction isn't always possible without conflict. Yes you can give everyone shelter, presumably. But not everyone gets a \"dacha\" on a warm seashore or a wonderful lakeside - some people get to either \"compete\" for those scarce resources (bye-bye communism), OR live worse quality of life. The fact that a fraction of society are always sociopaths/psychopaths; and many of them are smart enough to be able to channel their character \"legally\", within the system (or around it without being caught). Lack of competitiveness related to other states around you. The only way you can not lag long term and be a communist regime is to not have a competing free system with higher productivity driven by better incentive structures. The only way you can avoid a lot of your own high producers draining to a more competitive system is by threat of force. Welcome to dictatorship (anytime you prevent your citizens who wish to leave for greener pastures from doing so by threat of force, you are a closer to authorian than free state)."
594,Transition from parliamentary to presidential Republic?,NEUTRAL,Did any country in recent century successfully transitioned from parliamentary to presidential Republic (both of them reasonably unambiguously democratic - I'm pretty open as far as inclusiveness)?
595,Must all democratic countries have a constitution?,NEGATIVE,"It seems to me that all democratic countries, e.g. republics and representative monarchies, also have a constitution of sorts. On the other hand, what defines a democratic country is the \"power to the people\" ergo the ability to decide, directly or indirectly, what laws are passed. So, it's not so obvious to me that a constitution, in other words a primary set of rules, is necessary. Countries could do with tradition or simply with a set of laws, none of which are more fundamental than others. Is this correct? If yes, are there examples of democratic countries with no constitution or equivalent?"
596,"",NEGATIVE,"Most democratic countries have a written constitution, but it's not a requirement. The prime example of a country that lacks a constitution would be the United Kingdom."
597,"",NEGATIVE,"No, there are some that have none, but they are pretty rare. But all have some sort of replacement, sometimes unwritten, sometimes written but uncodified. I'm not aware of a single country outside the 5 below that don't have a codified written constitution and are considered democratic: Of course, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as Yannis's answer noted, has no written constitution. It instead has a set of basic documents, passed by Parlament (English Bill of Rights, Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, Habeas Corpus Act 1679 and Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949); which, in collection, function in constitutional capacity. Since the Glorious Revolution, the bedrock of the British constitution has traditionally been the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, according to which the statutes passed by Parliament are the UK's supreme and final source of law. (Wiki) Parliament can change the constitution simply by passing new Acts of Parliament. There is some debate about whether this principle remains valid, particularly in light of the UK's membership in the European Union (src) Israel is generally considered democratic, but has no constitution. However, they have \"Basic Laws\" that kinda, sorta functions in a similar capacity, maybe. Interestingly, one of the strong arguments against having a constitution, by David Ben-Gurion, was specifically the fact that UK has none :) There are fairly strong political movements in modern Israel which push for a constitution. E.g. Yisrael Beiteinu (until October 2012 the third largest party in Knesset, and which has just merged with Likud into what is generally considered the strongest party in Israel, Likud Yisrael Beiteinu) - has had as its electoral planks, and introduced into 15th Knesset - the creation of Constitution (as well as a change to Presidential form of government). Canada explicitly follows UK model The preamble to the Constitution of Canada declares that the constitution is to be \"similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom\". New Zealand has no codified constitution By some strange coincidence, it's part of UK-led Commonwealth realm. Perfidious Albion strikes again! San Marino has a codified set of several constitutional documents (differing from UK where they are uncodified). The Constitution of San Marino is distributed over a number of legislative instruments of which the most significant are the Statutes of 1600 and the Declaration of Citizen Rights of 1974 as amended in 2002. This is the only one of five known democratic countries without written codified constitution that is not explicitly modeling its lack of one on UK. Interesting fact: While Haiti is currently a constitutional democracy, it has had 24-25 Constitutions in the last 200 years, 5 of them in the last 50 years. Sounds like whoever designed Haiti's political system was hired by Google to be in charge of Chrome web browser versioning. As a side note, in Saudi Arabia the Quran is cited by Basic Law as the supreme source of law. But that doesn't quite apply as it is not a country that anyone would describe as \"democratic\"."
598,Are there polls indicating party preference by major/concentration?,NEGATIVE,"Most of the polls I saw seem to be fairly coarse and (for those that break out people by education) only break out people by whether they completed college, or postgrad, or none. Are there any good polls available that break out the party preference (any which way possible, either presidential voting or otherwise) by college major/concentration? I'm mostly curious as to what the differences are between STEM majors, social sciences, or law degrees and medical degrees. NOTES: This is mostly about USA, though I wouldn't reject a good answer pertaining to other countries. I would prefer high quality poll(s) - anything Nate Silver would put in a nice corner instead of naughty corner is how I judge. I'm mostly looking for coarse political alignments (D or R) but would definitely love to see polls delving into finer details on policy positions on major stuff."

This may not be all that surprising, given that the movement generally favors the significant limiting of government. One country where they have seen significant successes, however, is in Costa Rica under the Partido Movimiento Libertario banner. The party currently holds 9 of 57 seats in the legislature and their presidential candidate achieved a full 20% of the popular vote in the 2010 presidential elections. In addition to the success of individual candidates, Costa Rica also scores relatively high amongst libertarians as one of the most libertarian countries in the world. Costa Rica has relatively libertarian laws with respect to personal property, has no standing military and fairly low tax rates. Other countries that are often considered to be some of the most libertarian in the world include Liechtenstein, Hong Kong and Switzerland."
602,What are Jobbik's views on the Polish-Hungarian friendship?,NEGATIVE,"Clarification. I think this question is confusing to the answerers for some reason. I would like to make it clear that this question is not about the validity of the Hungarian Turanic ideology. It's also not a request for papers on Turanism. Please read the question before answering it. I do hope this question isn't going to be found too localized for this site. I'm sorry if I'm wrong. Jobbik is a major Hungarian party that embraces the Hungarian Turanic ideology, which is that Hungarians should ally first and foremost with the other (sic!) Turkic nations. ('Turkic' doesn't mean here what it usually means in scientific discourse.) In the words of the party's chairman, Gábor Vona: We, Hungarians are the most westerly of the Eastern people. If we put aside the lies about our Finno-Ugric origin, and only profess that we are the descendents of Atilla, we would suddenly find hundreds of millions ready to form a common basis for alliance. In fact, there are about two hundred million people living in the world today, who can say that they are descendants of Atilla. It is not possible, of course, to build a political strategy based on this fact alone. However, if we take a look at the countries from Bulgaria to Turkey and all the way across to Eastern Asia, we realise that we, Hungarians could have a lot of common political objectives with these countries. We come to realise that an alliance based and developed on the principles of Turanism instead of the Euro-Atlantic alliance would be more effective in serving the needs and interests of our nation. In order to avoid misunderstandings, we need to clarify that this would in no way mean that Hungary should separate from Europe. In fact, what we propose would mean a strengthening of our position in Europe, as Hungary could thus become the Western bastion of a Turanic alliance, as well as its representative within the European Union. We also need not worry about the fact that as a Christian nation, we would be dealing with non-Christian nations. Living a non-Christian way of life is already a common, wide-spread practice within the EU. Besides which, we can safely say that a true Muslim believer or any other true believer in their own country is closer to God the Almighty, than non-practicing Christians inhabiting Europe today. If Hungary wants to regain its positions as a strong player on the stage of international politics it should not head in the direction showed by Fidesz and MSZP, the clownish antics exhibited within the EU, but instead membership in a Turanic alliance, or if needed, its leading role and initiative in forming such an alliance. (Yes, he did misspell his purported ancestor's name twice.) It is also a conservative party. That being so, I would expect the party to be particularly concerned about the survival of the traditional Polono-Hungarian friendship. I do know that during this year's Independence Day celebrations, some Jobbik's youth wing's members came to Poland to march along with Poles. (The Polish political arena is extremely polarized these days, and there were in fact two separate celebrations in the country, each having an unfriendly or even hostile attitude toward the other. I do believe Jobbik's members came to join the celebrations of the more nationalist part of the Polish society.) This could say one of two things I think. It could mean that Jobbik or some of Jobbik's members wanted to help the nationalist ideas in a nearby country. They could do that everywhere. It could also be that Jobbik found it important to help Poland in particular, or at least the Polish nationalist, because of the long history of friendship between the two nations. However, my googling skills have been insufficient to find any more examples of Jobbik's commitment to the idea. Given the Turanic ideology the party expresses, it wouldn't be inconsistent if the party weren't committed to the idea very much. What I would like to know is the position of the party on the Polono-Hungarian relations, especially in light of the traditional friendship between the two nations. It would be great if you could quote the party's leaders in your answers. Please refrain from commenting on the validity of their political or historical views. This is not what this question is about."
603,"",NEGATIVE,"As stated, this question is pretty broad. You don't specify which first past the post system the citizens might want to change, at which level of government. I suspect you mean the United States, and perhaps national-level elections for e.g. member of Congress or US Senate. In the plain text of the question, the practical steps citizens can take to challenge a voting system are the same steps citizens can take to effect any other political change to an entrenched power structure: Organise. Act as a group, not as individuals. Learn. Find out what other similar changes have succeeded, and failed, and why. Find out what the power structures are. Find out what the alternatives you could propose are. Clarify goals, means, values. Be clear what you want to do, at what level, and for what reasons. Understand what you are willing to do to get there. Collaborate. Link up with groups that share your goals and values. Educate. Teach your fellow citizens what is wrong with the present situation, and what alternatives exist, and how they would be better. Often, the first step is helping people conceive that a different reality is even possible. Gather power. Raise funds. Strengthen your organisation. Exert power. Make change. Accept incremental wins. Reaching for intermediate goals, with intermediate successes, often helps energise your supporters and improve your tactics. In the case of elections to political office in the United States, I'd say that Organise, Learn, and Educate are the most important next steps. Fair Vote and the League of Women Voters of California are examples of organisations already working for electoral system reform. Some US jurisdictions have moved beyond first past the post elections for some offices: STV elections for Cambridge, MA, and Minneapolis, MN city councils and IRV elections for mayor of San Francisco, CA and several offices in Minneaopolis, MN. Education about alternatives to first past the post elections is an important next step in the USA today, because many people cannot conceive that alternatives exist, let alone understand what they are and how they are an improvement on \"first past the post\"."
605,"Why did Somalia fail as a state, and what keeps it from coming back?",VERY_NEGATIVE,"When considering a list of \"failed\" states, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Somalia are usually considered the textbook examples (see Fragile States Index, 2012). Yemen seems to have crawled back on its own after a nasty civil war, and Afghanistan failed because it was left in a vacuum from one superpower, only to be \"protected\" by another. But what is about about Somalia that caused it to fail, and, unlike the other two, seem to be stuck in such a state for so long?

607,Why does the EU keep Turkey out?,NEGATIVE,"Turkey has applied for membership in the EU several times, but unlike Greece, it has never been admitted. What are the reasons that the EU has given for denying membership to this large and influential country?"
608,"",NEGATIVE,"The biggest current stumbling block relating to Turkey's accession to the EU is around the dispute over Cyprus. Turkey refuses to implement a trade pact between Turkey and the EU that requires the Turkish government to allow Greek Cypriot vessels to use its air and sea ports, going against the customs agreement Turkey signed as a precondition to start EU membership negotiations. The Republic of Cyprus, although an EU member, is not officially recognised by Turkey and Turkey has stated it will refuse to recognise it until such time as the removal of the political and economic blockade on the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus - an area which is not recognised by any state but Turkey itself. This situation has prompted the EU to freeze negotiations on eight chapters of the acquis communautaire, negotiations which are required to be completed before EU member states can vote on the accession. Even without this freeze, only one chapter is considered to be completely aligned to acquis, with the majority requiring some to a lot of further effort."
609,"",NEGATIVE,"Turkey has a population of 75+ million and if the country entered the EU today, they would be the second largest member state behind Germany. This would mean an instant shift of power in almost every EU institution, more notably the European Parliament where seats are distributed to member states according to population. Turkey would instantly become a key player in European politics and would have more influence than the traditionally core countries, France, Italy, and the UK. Even if we don't consider anything else, it's understandable that Europeans would be wary of a membership that would significantly alter the EU's political and demographic map, and Turkey's massive population is often quoted as the key political reason the country's accession process is under such heavy scrutiny. Furthermore Turkey is not generally considered a part of Europe. It's the spiritual successor to the Ottoman Empire, an empire that was traditionally adversarial towards Europe, and its population is predominantly Muslim, while Europe's population is overwhelmingly Christian. A very small part of the country's territory, East Thrace, is in Europe and it's application may seem unlikely to be denied on geographic grounds, like Morocco's was, but still the question of whether Turkey should be considered a European country or not has been raised multiple times. A recent example is the following statement by Nicolas Sarkozy: I want to say that Europe must give itself borders, that not all countries have a vocation to become members of Europe, beginning with Turkey which has no place inside the European Union. Enlarging Europe with no limit risks destroying European political union, and that I do not accept. The statement is from 2007, two years after the violent Paris riots, a time when feelings for Muslim immigrants in France and in Europe in general were generally unfavourable. While Europe has been traditionally welcoming to immigrants, in recent years there's a strong anti-immigration sentiment across all major member states, a contributing factor to the steady rise of nationalism in Europe. Germany's position in 2010 was less critical but also not particularly enthusiastic in regards to full membership: The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will insist on 'privileged partnership' for Turkey instead of full EU membership when she visits the country next week, according to remarks published yesterday. 'There are intertwined relations between Turkey and the EU. There are 35 chapters in the [membership] talks. I am confident that 27-28 of them can be taken up and this will really mean a privileged partnership,' she said was quoted as saying by the Milliyet newspaper. 'Some issues, like institutional integration, will be left out of the scope,' she told a group of Turkish reporters, before a visit to Turkey on Monday and Tuesday. Mrs Merkel stressed, however, that the European Union placed 'great importance' on the need for Turkey to follow a foreign policy consistent with the bloc's stance. Germany's position that the sizeable, mainly Muslim, country is not fit for accession is backed by another EU heavyweight, France, but Ankara categorically rejects any alternatives that fall short of full membership. Given Turkey's predominantly Muslim population and its geographic location, the EU does not want to risk an influx of Muslim immigrants, simply put Turkey's accession would open a backdoor to Europe for immigrants from Arabic and African countries, at a time when immigration is an extremely hot issue in European countries and several countries have recently implemented anti-immigration laws that would seem extreme and unjustified a decade ago. A recent example is the decision to open detention camps for immigrants in Greece, an extremely controversial decision that in local media has been compared to Nazi Germany's detention camps. While this might seem like a local issue, we can't ignore the fact that most illegal immigrants reach Greece (and thus the EU) through Turkey. Moving on, there are two issues that can be blocking factors, the historically troublesome Greco-Turkish relations and Turkey's occupation of northen Cyprus. From the EC's 2005 Turkey Progress Report (page 9): As regards the enhanced political dialogue, relations with Greece developed positively. A series of bilateral agreements were signed and several confidence building measures adopted. A process of exploratory talks has continued. On Cyprus, over the last year Turkey has supported and continues to support the efforts of the UN Secretary General to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. The European Council of June 2004 invited Turkey to conclude negotiations with the Commission on behalf of the Community and its 25 Member States on the adaptation of the Ankara Agreement to take account of the accession of the new Member States. The Commission expects a positive reply to the draft protocol on the necessary adaptations transmitted to Turkey in July 2004 While Greco-Turkish relations have significantly improved in recent years, especially after the 1999 earthquakes that devastated İzmit and Athens, Greece reserves it's right to veto Turkey's membership at any time, especially since there are unresolved territorial disputes between the two countries. Greece did not intervene in the 1989 Davos proceedings, but it most certainly would have vetoed the negotiations if the EC viewed Turkey's membership favorably at the time. Graham's answer explain the Cyprus dispute, I'd only like to add that Cyprus can also veto Turkey's membership, and has already exercised the right once in 2006: Talks between Turkey and the EU over the largely Muslim country's entry to the world's biggest trading bloc headed for collapse at the first hurdle last night after Cyprus torpedoed a deal to kick-start the stalled negotiations. The Cyprus dispute has been a core issue in Europe - Turkey relations since 1974 but it became a blocking factor since 2004, when Cyprus joined the EU. It seems highly unlikely that Cyprus will accept Turkey's full membership without a satisfying resolution, at least in the near future."
610,"",NEGATIVE,"It's both a historical factor AND political correctness, which is obvious when you look at etymology on Wiki: French demographer, anthropologist and historian Alfred Sauvy, in an article published in the French magazine L'Observateur, August 14, 1952, coined the term Third World, referring to countries that were unaligned with either the Communist Soviet bloc or the Capitalist NATO bloc during the Cold War. His usage was a reference to the Third Estate, the commoners of France who, before and during the French Revolution, opposed priests and nobles, who composed the First Estate and Second Estate, respectively. Sauvy wrote, 'Like the third estate, the Third World is nothing, and wants to be something.' He conveyed the concept of political non-alignment with either the capitalist or communist bloc. Since Communist Soviet block, and the Cold War with it, is officially over, grouping the countries by geopolitical strategic alignment no longer works. Moreover, given Sauvy's analogy with 'worthless' peasant estate from the point of view of French nobles, one can understand that the label is somewhat insulting, at best. Given the egalitarian slant of modern discourse, it definitely isn't even remotely politically correct. Of course, as is usual with political correctness, people are now upset with the new 'developing vs. developed world' terms as well, e.g. http://tailsteak.com/archive.php?num=159 . (somewhat offtopic - this is typical, because labels frequently have root in reality, and as long as you want to label to real-different things, you will earlier or later run into real - instead of semantic - differences; and it's the former that the people who strongly care about political correctness don't like, whether they realize it or not)."
611,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"The terms are ambiguous, and their general definition shifted considerably after the cold war. Originally the three worlds referred to the cold war alliances, with the first world being the US and its allies, the second world being the USSR and its allies and the third world being the neutral countries. In the following map, third world countries by the cold war definition are shown in green: Switzerland is a typical third world country, isn't it? ;) The cold war definitions became irrelevant after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and even more so as traditionally communist countries shifted to a more Western model. After the cold war the definitions shifted to reflecting the \"worlds\" broad economic status, and by that definition many of the cold war adversaries, including both the US and Russia, would be placed in the first world. The change in definition, from political ideology to economy, contributed to the gradual disuse of \"second world\" that by the later definition would mean countries that are somewhere in between poverty and prosperity. Without as clear a line between first and second world countries, the term became more confusing than accurate. Developed and developing country and emerging economy are also vague and broad terms, but their definitions are constant and don't carry the no longer relevant cold war baggage."
612,"",NEGATIVE,"Turkey will not become a member of the EU, simply because no one wants it to. There is no Turkish politician I can imagine who would cede power to Brussels to the extent EU membership would require. Structural changes since the 80s have done a lot erode Turks' inferiority complex when it comes to Europe. In Europe, you can't find a core country where 51% of the population is comfortable with the idea that Turks might have equal status. Occasionally, it was convenient in terms of domestic Turkish politics to look as if the government is doing its best to join the EU, but lately they have stopped pretending. If you want to get bogged down in the details, you can always do a full blown analysis of this or that treaty. For a real understanding, however, you'd be wasting your time. At the end of the 17th century, the Ottoman Empire came close to swallowing Europe. At the end of the First World War, the Europeans came close to splitting the entire Ottoman Empire among them. Therein lies the rub. Immigration is a red herring: Various governments are falling over each other, trying to give visas to Turkish tourists. For a lot of people in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, in addition to the former Soviet Union, Turkey itself is the final destination of their illegal immigration journey. Cyprus is a red herring since reunification was rejected by the Greek Cypriots in 2004. For the last three decades, I have advocated the position that there is nothing in Europe but a crumbling centrally planned economy. Turkey and the Turks, trying to shed a statist, stagnant, centrally planned past, have no use for that."
613,Gun prevalence vs homicide rates - correlation and causation,NEGATIVE,The discussion on gun ownership is often heated and detached from facts. What does science say on correlation and more importantly on causality between gun prevalence and homicide rates?

614,Is there evidence that the Mercator Projection map leads to real European colonial tendencies?,NEGATIVE,"The classic Mercator Projection has been around since 1569 as a sailing map. However, in order to represent lines of constant course for sailing vessels as straight lines on the map, the areas around the poles were significantly exaggerated, while the areas around the equator are relatively smaller than they are in reality. As a result, the map accurately represents the shapes of various planetary features (continents, oceans, etc.) but appears proportionally much different than reality. In an attempt to solve this issue, a different projection, the Gall-Peters Projection, was developed in the 20th century to maintain fidelity of proportion as well. Proponents of the Gall-Peters map suggest that an unintended consequence of the classic Mercator projection is to reinforce European colonial tendencies because it exaggerates the size of western countries like those in Europe and the United States while vastly under-sizing, specifically, the continent of Africa. Is there any evidence for the assertion that there is a correlation between the prevalence of the Mercator projection and the strength of European colonial tendencies? Is the claim statistically significant and if so, has there been any country that has sought to adopt the Gall-Peters Projection for official use (specifically in education)?"
617,"",NEGATIVE,"There were absolutely no articles, blogs, or studies that I could find that suggested causation at all. Below is a list of articles that attempt to prove or disprove correlation. This blog post attempts to show correlation, if any, on a scatter plot between gun ownership and murder / crime rates. From the article: It has the following data for all 50 states (except Florida, which does not submit the data for some reason): Brady Score (how much gun control a state has) Murder Rate per 100k population Firearm murder rate per 100k population Firearm Murder % and I added Violent Crime Rate per 100k population The following are the scatter plots that he generated, which (in the author's analysis and findings) show no statistical correlation between gun ownership and firearm murder or crime rate. The original source for the article is another blog post that can be found here. Looking at US data, another blogger did scatter plot analysis using source data from the About.com US Liberal Politics page and the Gun violence in the United States Wikipedia page. He concludes that: There is literally 0 correlation between how many people own firearms, and the homicide rate with firearms, or overall homicide rate as below graphs and correlation coefficients illustrate. His graphs are shown here: In yet another scatterplot analysis of correlation between gun ownership and murder rate by country (again, using Wikipedia as the source), the author find a negative correlation between gun ownership and rate of homicide. He also makes a comment that these statistics aren't very helpful in the debate. From the article: If all countries are included in the plot, there is a negative correlation between gun ownership and rate of homicide. Only when the plot is limited to OECD countries (with the outliers of US and Mexico included), does a very small positive correlation appear. ... Because of the many uncontrolled variables involved in comparisons between countries, I don’t believe such statistics can help the case for or against gun control. I’m posting them here to counter the claims by advocates of increased governmental gun control that the statistics legitimise their preference. A separate study entitled Would Banning Firearms Reduce Murder and Suicide? A Review of International and Some Domestic Evidence done by Don B. Kates (an American Criminologist and Attorney) and Gary Mauser (a Canadian Criminologist), was published in Volume 30, Number 2 of the Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy (pp. 649-694). The authors in this article found that there is no correlation between gun ownership and murder. From the article: The non‐correlation between gun ownership and murder is reinforced by examination of statistics from larger numbers of nations across the developed world. Comparison of “homicide and suicide mortality data for thirty‐six nations (including the United States) for the period 1990–1995” to gun ownership levels showed “no significant (at the 5% level) association between gun ownership levels and the total homicide rate.” Consistent with this is a later European study of data from 21 nations in which “no significant correlations [of gun ownership levels] with total suicide or homicide rates were found.” The authors then go on to say that they found a negative correlation between gun ownership and violent crime, meaning that populations with higher gun ownership had fewer incidents of violent crime. From the article: The same pattern appears when comparisons of violence to gun ownership are made within nations. Indeed, “data on firearms ownership by constabulary area in England,” like data from the United States, show “a negative correlation,” that is, “where firearms are most dense violent crime rates are lowest, and where guns are least dense violent crime rates are highest.” Another book entitled More Guns, Less Crime, written by John Lott, studies crime data for every county in the United States during 29 years from 1977 to 2005 and finds no correlation between gun ownership and murder and concludes that allowing concealed handguns decreases violent crime rates. The wikipedia page (linked to above) for the book has a slew of papers that argue for and against his conclusions. The Statistics section of the Gun Politics Wikipedia page references a slew of reports, studies, and anecdotes against gun control. There are several sites that display or visualize data, but whose authors don't make any claims or assessments on correlation or causality whatsoever. The Guardian published data in an article entitled Gun homicies and gun ownership listed by country that can be downloaded an analyzed. They also have an interactive heat map that displays the following data: Average firearms per 100 people Homicide by firearm rate per 100,000 population % of homicides by firearm This is a screenshot of the heatmap: I took a (very) shallow dive into the data, looking at a 3-4 countries from each continent and there doesn't seem to be much correlation between ownership rates and murder rates. One commenter on the article makes an interesting point that we can't use the univariate solution of Gun Control to solve a multivariate problem of murder. He says: If the rate of gun ownership is a determinant of the gun murder rate, how does one explain the gun ownership rates in Mexico (15 guns /100 and 9.97 murders/100k) and Jamaica (8.1 guns/100 and 39.4 murders /100K) and the very high gun murder rates? Guatemala has a gun ownership rate of 13.1/100 and a murder rate of 34/100k. The US has 88.8 guns/100 and 2.97 murders/ 100k. Univariate solutions for multivariate problems are unsatisfying. On the other side of the debate, the article entitled Rates of Household Firearm Ownership and Homicide Across US Regions and States, 1988–1997 concludes as follows: Although our study cannot determine causation, we found that in areas where household firearm ownership rates were higher, a disproportionately large number of people died from homicide. FactCheck.org reviewed studies in 2008 and posted Violent Crimes and Handgun Ownership. They looked at a study by David Hemenway (director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center and the Harvard Youth Violence Prevention Center), who reviewed commonly cited research from peer-reviewed journals. From the FactCheck.org article: It found that studies of the United States or U.S. cities, states and regions \"generally find a statistically significant gun prevalence-homicide association.\" The report said that the evidence from such \"U.S. cross-sectional studies is quite consistent … where there are higher levels of gun prevalence, homicide rates are substantially higher, primarily due to higher firearm homicide rates.\" With regard to a causal relationship, FactCheck.org says: That’s not to say that taking the guns away from such areas would necessarily lead to a reduction in the murder rate. Such studies have shown a statistically significant relationship between guns and murder but not a causal one. Disclaimer: I haven't personally reviewed the original sources or the analysis behind the sources I'm referencing. I'm not making an argument, one way or the other, as to whether or not I agree with the findings in these articles. I posted these because I think the format and nature of the findings in are specifically relevant to the original question. Disclaimer 2: I listed many more articles that show little to no correlation, because it was more difficult to find ones that demonstrated a significant correlation. I am happy to add references to more articles that show positive correlation (or even causation) if you post them in the comments."
618,"",NEGATIVE,"It appears that there have not been many (or any) peer reviewed studies that show a causal relationship between gun ownership and violent crime. There have been studies that show a statistically significant relationship, but causality as you know is a much higher burden to prove. There is a good discussion of the entire topic in scientific terms at this link. In summation, it appears that higher gun ownership does imply higher rates of violent crime, but causation cannot be shown in the data available: That’s not to say that taking the guns away from such areas would necessarily lead to a reduction in the murder rate. Such studies have shown a statistically significant relationship between guns and murder but not a causal one."
619,"",NEGATIVE,"tl;dr> Correlation != Causation. The difficulty in achieving any statistically relevant study is that you only have one data point - namely the expansion of all colonial empires correlated with the time period of the Mercator projection. Thus, strictly speaking, you only have one degree of freedom in terms of data, constraining you to one exogenous variable. That is simply insufficient to construct any type of model that has any residual explanatory power. Prior to the Mercator projection, you only had Ptolemy's Maps which were based on star sightings, and were accurate as far as latitude was concerned, but not longitude. As such, there was no scientifically rigorous way of approximating land area in visual form. For this reason, after Herschel's clock enabled longitude to be reckoned with precision for the first time, the King of France could decry the loss of 20% of his empire (which had been calculated based on approximations of longitude, rather than reality.) But, to ascribe to Ptomley the propagandistic effect of exaggerating longitude in order to enhance the Kingdom of France would be laughable, not least of the reasons of which are that Ptolemy's purpose was simply to arrange cities north to south and to make a best guess at east west relations. And, while Ptolemy had Erothanes' best guess as to the measure of the earth, there is not as much evidence that Mercator did, not that he particularly would have cared. Mercator's goal was to make the lives of the sea captians easier. The fact of the matter with regards to the Peters-Gall Projection, or any other projection for that matter, is that the creators of any map do have a point that a bias is inherent to the visualization. And indeed, Mark Monomer's How to Lie With Maps cites many persuasive pieces of propoganda that have been used throughout the years. But, to attribute a propagandistic motive to Mercator is an accusation after the fact. As pointed out, Mercator's projection allowed for simple dead reckoning by sailors. If it had an unintended propagandistic side effect, that is not documented nor is it statistically testable. Thus to answer the question directly, yes, in fact, on 100% of the earth's using the Mercator Projection, it is correlated with a group of nations that were colonial empires in nature. And, in 100% of the earth's prior to it, you also had colonial empires, such as Rome, China, the Maya and Aztec, the Indus, etc... Whether or not it is causative, however, lies beyond the realm of statistics to answer, because there is simply an insufficient number of earth's to reproduce the hypothesis."

They claim that it's really important for them to reach some monetary goal by the deadline in order for the campaign to succeed. How much of this is actually true, and how much is just a sales pitch?

No different from \"Buy this XYZ service ASAP while this wonderful offer is in effect\" or \"Urgently pounce on this while the supplies last!!!\". Not really special to politics. It stems from basic psychology - people are more likely to commit to a choice if they see a deadline. Second, the campaigns are like businesses. They make hiring and firing decisions and other budgetary decisions once they know their budgets. Straight from the horse's (e.g. Obama Campaign's) mouth: That's why this deadline on Tuesday matters. Our hiring decisions are based on what our budget looks like on August 1st. Third, because the FEC reports on the numbers only up to the deadline. A campaign looks better if the reported numbers are higher for a variety of reasons - please note that Nate Silver's model includes fundraising #s into its parameters so it DOES matter. The speed here matters, as it's a positive feedback loop - the more money you raise faster, the more successful your campaign looks, the more willing people will be to donate/volunteer later. https://my.democrats.org/page/contribute/midnight Whatever we have in the bank when that clock strikes midnight will be an important measure of how ready we are to take on the other side."

628,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"Let's look at Wikipedia's characteristics of a failed state: A failed state is a state perceived as having failed at some of the basic conditions and responsibilities of a sovereign government. There is no general consensus on the definition of a failed state. The definition of a failed state according to the Fund for Peace is often used to characterize a failed state: loss of control of its territory, or of the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force therein erosion of legitimate authority to make collective decisions an inability to provide public services Given that a large chunk of Somali territory is controlled by a rebel Islamic Emirate of Somalia, and the northwest chunk by a self-declared-sovereign Somaliland, you can see that it easily fits the first criteria (see the map below), which is in practice the only one that matters (if you can't enforce your rules and laws, you won't be able to provide public services or have legitimate authority state-wide). The main reasons it failed as a state are because of: Unwillingness of various parties who conflicted there (resulting in a civil war) to come to a compromise. The country is comprised from heterogeneous set of territories, as can be seen on this Wiki map: Somaliland is in essence an independent sub-state. This may have something to do with the fact that as it stands, Somalia is as much of an artificial construct geopolitically as other unstable countries; that were united basically by the will of a foreign imperial power (e.g. Crymean situation in Ukraine thanks to USSR, Near-Dnestr conflict in Moldavia, India-Pakistan conflicts over Jammu and Kashmir thanks to Brits, Sudan/South Sudan thanks to Brits and to some degree Ottomans).

Take that article: http://www.landonswan.com/personal/gun-control-vs-murdercrime-rates-a-statistical-look/ which finds no relevant correlation between gun control and violent crime rate. But the problem is, it's based on internal USA statistics only. The author should be asked, how such data could be relevant in any way, because we have only one country that is analyzed. What's the difference what laws are in particular states, taken there's no border control between states? Another cited article: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jul/22/gun-homicides-ownership-world-list analyzes gun control and crime rate in various countries, but there are much more differences between those countries than gun control only.

But single example can't prove anything. However, gun control is not 0-1 value. The ban is one thing, the control is the other. This is another factor that should be taken into account. How much arms there are per 100 people - this doesn't tell WHO has this arms, hunters, criminals or maybe collectors. My personal suggestion: look carefully on the list http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate. Look which countries have the lowest crime rate. If you want to reduce violence, you should copy the concepts from those countries, but copying single concept such as gun control is too little, the whole system should be taken into account."
630,What are the criteria for avoiding the fiscal cliff?,NEGATIVE,"One of the biggest items in the news is that we will go off the \"Fiscal cliff\" (large amount of tax increases and spending cuts) if Congress doesn't come to an agreement of some kind. My question is: What is it that Congress has to agree to in order to avoid the fiscal cliff? Does Congress have to reduce the deficit equal to what the fiscal cliff would? Can Congress just decide to renege on certain items of the fiscal cliff? For instance if everyone agreed that they wanted to extend a portion of the Bush tax cuts, and change nothing else, could they do just that? Or, does the sequester require that they make account for that elsewhere? Can Congress come up with a different budget deal that would reduce the deficit less than the sequester would? Can Congress just decide to discard the sequester altogether?"
631,"",NEGATIVE,"In truth, Congress could do any of the above. The sequester itself is itself just a Congressional statute like any other and can be amended, overridden or replaced by another Congressional statute. Now, that doesn't mean the political will is there for some of the options you have laid out, but there is no requirement tied to the legislation passed during the debt ceiling negotiations last year that created the groundwork for the \"fiscal cliff\" that would actually prevent these scenarios from coming to pass. So, the only thing Congress needs to agree to in order to address the fiscal cliff is some legislation that can get through both the House and Senate and be signed by the President (which is anything but an easy proposition as we have already seen). The real question then is what options are politically palatable enough that they are being discussed. There are two main components to the cliff. The first are a series of tax reductions that are set to expire at the end of the year including payroll, income, unemployment benefits, the Alternative Minimum Tax, and new taxes related to the Affordable Care Act (among others). The second component are a series of automatic spending cuts, referred to as the \"sequester\", which were put into effect as part of the debt limit discussions last year as a stick to get Congress to act because the cuts were deemed so bad by both sides. It includes roughly $600 billion in cuts from the Defense budget and another $600 billion in cuts from discretionary (non-entitlement) domestic spending. So, importantly, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are largely unaffected. The President has insisted that on the tax front, all tax rates remain the same for everyone making less than $250,000 a year, and that the tax rates on those making more than that (for married couples filing jointly), rates should return to their Clinton era levels. This would raise roughly $1.2 trillion dollars, and as a result Republicans have insisted in at least that amount being cut from spending programs. In what the President refers to as a \"balanced approach\" he has offered Congress between $800 billion (originally) and most recently $1.2 trillion in spending reductions that are from more palatable programs than the sequester would cut (this reduced the burden on Defense and included cuts to Medicare and tying Social Security cost of living adjustments to the Consumer Price Index so that they would go up slower). Republicans believe the President's cuts are not sufficient, and that due to accounting tricks, the offer was more in the neighborhood of $900 billion (not $1.2 trillion) in spending reductions and have rejected this offer. House Speaker John Boehner countered with what he calls \"Plan B\". This only addressed the tax portion of the \"fiscal cliff\" leaving the sequester in place and would have left tax rates at their current levels for everyone making less than $1 million (rather than $250,000 like the President wants). This failed to pass the House last week because he could not get enough Republicans to vote for it (all Democrats would have voted against it as well). On December 28th, the President offered a new plan, very similar to his original plan on taxes, but that would remove all the spending cuts and push out the deadline on the sequester potion between 60-90 days. There has yet to be a response on this effort by the Republicans in Congress."

It measures liberalism vs conservatism as opposed to Democrat/Republican, but it's close to what you're looking for. (pdf) It suggests that Engineering and Business majors tend to hold more conservative views on both social and economic stances, and that Bio/Lab, social sciences, and fine arts majors have more liberal views. nearly all catagories of college major on average are more conservative on social issues than they are on economic issues. I also came across that Huffington Post article that Michael linked. The article suggests that economics majors tend to be more republican: The number of economics courses completed by the graduates of these... schools significantly decreases the likelihood that a person does not join a political party and the likelihood of joining the Democratic party, while the number of economics courses is positively related to the likelihood of joining the Republican party. For example, taking five economics courses is associated with an eight percent decrease in the likelihood of joining the Democratic party and more than a 10 percent higher chance of joining the Republican party."
633,How is it that a corporation would not derive rights from the people inside it. (speech in particular),NEGATIVE,"This is a political issue that I genuinely don't understand very well. I don't have to go very far to hear opposition to the fact that currently corporations are protected under the first amendment. I have always been confused by this. I was under the assumption that when ever a corporation \"speaks\" either an executive, the board of directors, the shareholders, a spokesperson, etc has to decide what the corporation \"says\", and they, as people, have the freedom of speech. The problem is that I never hear that point made unless i specifically seek it out. It's as though the answer seems so obvious to everyone else. What am I missing here? I understand that a lot of the current debate is about whether or not money equals speech, and that that question and the one I'm asking are highly related, but they're also different questions. I'm not asking about whether money = speech."
634,"",NEGATIVE,"The formal answer to your question is, the only thing necessary in order to avoid the (U.S. January 2013) \"fiscal cliff\", is for the Congress and the President to pass a bill into law that amends those pre-existing laws which change taxes and spending as of January 2013. There is no formal requirement that any problems get solved. But maybe you are asking about the political situation. The \"fiscal cliff\" exists because the Congress and the President in the past enacted bills into law that put off decisions on hard questions, and set up tax and spending changes which happen on January 2013, in order to force their successors to grapple with the decisions. In particular, the timing was chosen so that the grappling would happen after the results of the November 2012 U.S. elections were known. The political reality is that it will take both sides to agree to amend the pre-existing tax and spending changes. That agreement won't happen unless some of the tough decisions get made in a satisfactory way… or unless the current Congress and President decide to put off the decisions again. All the talk about requiring tax cuts to expire for the richest taxpayers, or raising the debt ceiling, or cutting spending, or fixing the trajectory of entitlement programs, is all describing the agendas of the current Congress and President. Its the framework they use to describe where they agree and disagree. But they have the authority to ignore that framework, and enact a bill into law which fixes some, all, or none of the problems they are faced with. To answer your specific questions directly: does Congress have to reduce the deficit equal to what the fiscal cliff would? No. can Congress just decide to renege on certain items of the fiscal cliff? Yes. for instance if everyone agreed that they wanted to extend a portion of the Bush tax cuts, and change nothing else, could they do just that? Yes. or does the sequester require that they make account for that elsewhere? Maybe the existing laws call for it, but the current Congress and President can ignore that call. So No. Can congress come up with a different budget deal that would reduce the deficit less than the sequester would? Yes. Can congress just decide to discard the sequester altogether? Yes."
635,"",NEGATIVE,"This fakeroversy was popularized most recently by a fictional organization, the Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality in the West Wing. Yes, it is clear that the prevalence of Mercator projections is directly related to the strength of European colonial tendencies. Ships were the dominant form of transportation at the time, and Mercator projections have advantages over a Gall-Peter's projection in that a straight line drawn on the map charts a constant course/bearing. The Gall-Peters projection has other shortcomings that make it less desireable. It does have severe shape distortion, and its distortion pattern greatly changes along a meridian (the Mercator projection has no local shape distortion). There is of course distance distortion (infinite at the poles, as in all cylindrical projections), and distance is only preserved along the two standard parallels. Area distortion is certainly absent; on the other hand, many other equal-area projections already existed, several with much lesser overall shape distortion (cartographers were especially aggravated by Peters's suggestions, at least initially, that his was the first equal-area projection). Finally, the Mercator projection was a false target for criticism, since it was designed as a navigation device, and never intended for world maps Bob Abramms of ODT, Inc., a publisher of the Peters map, recently wrote an article advocating the map in the National Council for Geographic Education's (NCGE) publication, Perspective. \"The problem of misinformed and overzealous Peters projection fans has been a long-standing one. In fact, the problems seems to have originated with map creator Dr. Arno Peters himself. [...] The Peters projection is of limited value, if taken in isolation. However, it is a rich learning tool when taken in combination with other projections.\" This article resulted in a response to the editor of Perspective that was published in the following issue. Dr. Thomas Feldman succinctly summarized the opposition to the Peters projection. Please, let's use this map as an example of what it is -- a scam capitalizing on the cartographic ignorance of most people and, sad to say, many teachers at all levels, and which survives quite nicely in a climate of political correctness where it is inappropriate to criticize anyone who claims to criticize the \"the status quo\"... I'm afraid that keeping the debate alive only confuses the ignorant --- they've been led to believe they know what \"racist\" maps look like because some teachers keep comparing a Mercator to a Gall-Peters in an inappropriate and misleading racial context. No schools are adopting a Gall-Peters projection map, because it isn't a good map for a world atlas. My grade school had a Winkel tripel projection, with Azimuthal projections of the distorted polar regions. Then there is the more recent Robinson Projection, adopted by the National Geographic Society. All projections have distortions of some sort, because they are trying to make a spherical object to a plane. To avoid all distortions, there is a mapping technique that has been around for ages, and is found in classrooms regularly...its called a globe."

638,"",NEGATIVE,"I imagine you are reacting to the US Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010). This decision (and here I'm summarising a very well-written and footnoted Wikipedia article) held that: ...it was unconstitutional to ban free speech through the limitation of independent communications by corporations, associations, and unions, i.e. that corporations and labor unions may spend their own money to support or oppose political candidates through independent communications like television advertisements. The article quotes the decision as saying, \"If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.\" Note that they mention \"associations of citizens\" separately from \"citizens\". They say that \"associations of citizens\" are protected, separately from the rights of individuals who make up the association. This is not all that different from treating a Corporation as a separate legal entity from the persons who own the corporation, or who work for the corporation. There is a related concept of Corporate Personhood, which also has a well-written Wikipedia article. It summarises the concept as: Corporate personhood is the legal concept that a corporation may sue and be sued in court in the same way as natural persons or unincorporated associations of persons. This doctrine in turn forms the basis for legal recognition that corporations, as groups of people, may hold and exercise certain rights under the common law and the U.S. Constitution. The doctrine does not hold that corporations are \"people\" in the most common usage of the word, nor does it grant to corporations all of the rights of citizens.... This article says, in talking about political-spending aspects of Corporate Personhood, \"It should be noted, however, that neither [the Citizen United nor a \"Buckley\" (1976)] decision relied on the concept of corporate personhood.\" I think it's worth also mentioning, related to protections corporations have under the First Amendment, some misunderstandings about the Citizens United deicsion from that Wikipedia article: This ruling was frequently interpreted as permitting corporations and unions to donate to political campaigns, or else removing limits on how much a donor can contribute to a campaign. However, these claims are incorrect, as the ruling did not affect the 1907 Tillman Act's ban on corporate campaign donations (as the Court noted explicitly in its decision), nor the prohibition on foreign corporate donations to American campaigns, nor did it concern campaign contribution limits. The Citizens United decision did not disturb prohibitions on corporate contributions to candidates, and it did not address whether the government could regulate contributions to groups that make independent expenditures. The Citizens United ruling did however remove the previous ban on corporations and organizations using their treasury funds for direct advocacy. These groups were freed to expressly endorse or call to vote for or against specific candidates, actions that were previously prohibited.... If you are interested in this subject, I highly recommend reading the Wikipedia articles on both Citizens United and Corporate Personhood, and following the links they contain. Good work, Wikipedians!"
639,"Are all retroactive laws, ex post facto laws?",NEGATIVE,"In the United States, Congress' seeming inability to pass a fiscal cliff bill before the 1/1/13 12:00 AM deadline has sparked discussion that Congress could potentially pass a bill sometime in January and make its effects retroactive to the 1/1/13 12:00 AM deadline, thus eliminating any effect that their delay would have had. As I understand them, ex post facto laws are any law that attempts to change the legal status of a person's actions after the fact. Additionally, these types of laws are expressly forbidden by the United States Constitution. Since a retroactive fiscal cliff deal would change the legal obligations of all taxpayers on January 1, 2013 after the fact, would this not be an unconstitutional use of Congress' power? If not, what criteria of an ex post facto law is missing in this example?"
640,"",NEGATIVE,"In addition the comments by @Brendan about the selection process and legal distinction between the United States Constitution and the British parliamentary structure, it seems that this question attempts to get at the reasons for, and potential consequences of, the following question: Given the importance of the Separation of Powers doctrine between branches of government throughout the world, what maintains a legislative check on the executive in the United Kingdom, given that he is selected from the legislative body? In practice, how do the legislative and executive branches operate efficiently given the overlap in membership? First, the reason for this construction is fairly easy to uncover given the evolution of government in the United Kingdom throughout history. Unlike the United States which had a hard and fast split from the United Kingdom and a deliberate period of establishing an entirely new government, the government of the United Kingdom has grown and evolved for centuries into what it is today. This gradual evolution from a tribal society, to a pure monarchy to the democracy we see today is the main reason the United Kingdom does not have a distinctly independent executive. Ever since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 the people of the United Kingdom have been trying to wrestle more power away from the monarchy and into the hands of the people. This led to the creation of Parliament with the power to pass some laws. Eventually, that power extended to all laws, including constraints on the monarchy. However, as the monarchy existed throughout this period, and continues today, even as the executive power transitioned away from the monarchy, the task of selecting a new executive came from the one established power source that existed, Parliament. This is the same reason that unlike many modern democracies, the United Kingdom does not have one constitutional document, but rather a collection of laws that together make up the basis for their government. The United States on the other hand had the opportunity to start with a clean slate, with the opportunity to lay out all of their institutions in the best way the Founding Fathers could think of, and they wanted an independent executive in order to help differentiate themselves from the system they had just rebelled against. Determining the potential consequences of the executive being so intertwined with the legislative branch is a bit more nuanced. Both nations (the United States and United Kingdom) believe that the power of the executive should be held in check by a strong legislative branch and allow the legislature to pass laws limiting the power of the executive and even remove them from office (impeachment proceedings in the United States and a vote of no confidence in the United Kingdom). The real difference between the two systems is that the United States has a two party system and the United Kingdom a multiparty system. In the United States, where there are only two dominate parties and the majority has enough votes to pass legislation on their own the power of a legislative executive could be almost unlimited. However, in the United Kingdom where the majority party may not have an outright majority and coalitions between multiple parties both in opposition or in forming a government are often required, the power of the majority party is much less. This makes the power of the opposition to force a vote of no confidence a much more plausible event than impeachment proceedings in the United States and leads to a more practical check on the executive's power. For example, in the United Kingdom today the government is formed by a coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats with a Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister from different parties. In addition to the head of the government, the real work of the government in both countries is handled by cabinet secretaries and ministers and both countries have restrictions on these offices. In the United States, a person selected to serve in these offices must immediately resign any other elected office they hold. Similar rules exist in the United Kingdom as well as limits on how many can be selected from the House of Commons, House of Lords, etc. This ensures that the work of both branches of government can continue effectively and allows for a real distinction between the branches of government, despite the overlap at the Prime Minister level."
641,"What caused a change in Bo Xilai's support for \"elitists\" into support for \"populists\"?",NEGATIVE,"Bo Xilai Wiki's Political alignment and affiliations section states that: In the course of his career, Bo Xilai was the beneficiary of considerable patronage from former Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin. He is thus associated with Jiang’s faction, sometimes referred to as the “elitists,” that is generally known to favor a model that emphasizes free trade, economic development in the coastal regions, and export-led growth. ... By contrast, the “populist” coalition of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao advocates more balanced economic development and improvements to China’s social safety net. The populist faction is generally associated with the 'left,' and comprised rural leaders, socialist intellectuals, and several leaders who rose to prominence through their connections with the Communist Youth League. (emphasis mine) Yet, once he became a figure in Chongqing's politics, the ideas and affiliations seemed to have changed 180 degrees: Although Bo is identified with the elitist bloc for his time in Liaoning and as Minister of Commerce, during his tenure in the interior city of Chongqing, he adopted a number of populist policies more typically associated with the left. Namely, he implemented social housing programs, gave residency status (and therefore the associated social welfare benefits) to rural migrant workers, and emphasized a need for a more balanced distribution of wealth. Although Bo relentlessly pursued technology, capital, and business opportunities, he also spearheaded a large number of government programs to help the working class and disadvantaged groups. Bo’s campaigns against corruption also allegedly seized the assets of private entrepreneurs, in turn funneling these funds into state projects and welfare programs, effectively re-asserting state control over wealth. He also sought to promote “red culture,” and mandated the revival of Mao-era slogans and songs, evoking a time of an egalitarian society. (emphasis mine) Question Is it known what exactly led to such a drastic political idea/orientation change?"
642,Is legalization of marijuana legal in the United States?,NEGATIVE,"The question posed here is whether the states' partial nullification of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is legal. Under the supremacy clause, federal law and statute should trump state law, but essentially what is occurring today (2012) is states passing laws neutering the CSA's power over marijuana, but states today have nonetheless passed laws permitting recreational use (see Washington). Is such action permitted under the Constitution?"
643,"",NEGATIVE,"from http://www.usconstitution.net/glossary.html#EXPOST: 1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offense, in order to convict the offender. Notice how that definition does not waver from criminal law. It means that you can't get prosecuted for something that wasn't against the law when the act happened. If Congress does anything to the fiscal cliff in January, it won't cause anyone to have already committed a crime, therefore it won't violate the interpretation of ex post facto law. Also, If a fiscal cliff agreement does get passed, people will, if anything, have a smaller tax burden, so the point is moot in the scope of the fiscal cliff."

Madison, the Supreme Court has decided that it is the ultimate authority on what is or isn't constitutional. They have ruled that tax law is exempt from that section of the Constitution. In 1986, in a move to encourage the growth of employee stock ownership plans (ESOP), congress allowed companies to deduct half the proceeds from the sale of company stock to ESOP. An enterprising individual did, taking a $600k loss but saving $2.5 million in taxes. In 1987, the IRS discovered that this tax change was going to cost them more than expected, so congress retroactively amended the law. In UNITED STATES v. CARLTON, the court found: The 1987 amendment's retroactive application to Carlton's 1986 transactions does not violate due process. Under the applicable standard, a tax statute's retroactive application must be supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means. See, e.g., Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R. A. Gray &amp; Co., 467 U.S. 717, 729-730 Another issue here, is even if it were unconstitutional, you would need someone with standing to bring the case to court.

This is because creating and enforcing drug law is not one of the powers enumerated for Congress in the Constitution so the CSA is based on regulating the trafficking in marijuana across state lines and its impact on the national economy (something that Congress does have power to control via the Commerce Clause). All we have to go on with respect to the Court's thinking on the Commerce Clause and its intersection with marijuana is the recent precedent in Gonzales v. Raich where the Court found broad powers for Congress to regulate marijuana because of its interstate effects. In this case, even the personal growth of marijuana for individual in-home medical use (as allowed by state law in California) could have negative impacts on interstate commerce and therefore could be regulated by Congress. Importantly, the reasoning of the Court in the case started with the unchallenged presumption, conceded by both sides, that Congress had the authority to regulate marijuana for non-medical uses. The Court then went on to say that because marijuana grown for medical reasons could be used for non-medical reasons (perhaps the product was stolen and transported across state lines) it could also be banned by Congress to prevent that activity from occurring. From that decision: The parallel concern making it appropriate to include marijuana grown for home consumption in the CSA is the likelihood that the high demand in the interstate market will draw such marijuana into that market. Given that the Court took as a foundational assumption in Raich that non-medical use of marijuana could be banned and that above and beyond that so could medical marijuana, the likelihood of these laws standing up against a court challenge seems unlikely, but only time will tell for sure. In practice today, however, the Obama administration has chosen to focus their efforts on what they call higher priority issues facing the Department of Justice (budgets and resources are limited after all) and have chosen thus far not to enforce the CSA violations in these states."
650,What legal impediments might there be to alternate voting systems?,NEGATIVE,"Most jurisdictions in the US use first-past-the-post voting. This appears to me to be a historical artifact; I'm not aware of any legal impediments on a federal level that would prevent states or municipalities from using any voting system they want, so long as it treats all votes equally. Are there any such federal restrictions of which I might be unaware? Further, are there any state-level roadblocks? In Tennessee, where I live, I'm not aware of any legal restriction on municipalities selecting their own voting systems. Do any other states have such restrictions?"
651,Why is insincere/tactical/strategic voting considered undesirable?,VERY_NEGATIVE,"In most of scholarly discussions about voting systems, the implication seems to be that one of the desired goals is to minimize/eliminate insincere/tactical/strategic voting: Tactical voting is commonly regarded as a problem, since it makes the actual ballot into a nontrivial game, where voters react and counter-react to what they expect other voters' strategies to be. Is there an actual scholarly or political science research showing that efficacy of tactical voting is an undesirable property of a voting system aside from \"well, it makes voting more complicated and if you don't do it right you may accidentally end up with worse electeds\"? Nobody is forced to use tactical voting strategies, so if you use one incorrectly (as opposed to sincerely voting your preferences), it should be your problem, not the voting system's."

These provisions bar Congress from passing laws that penalize a category of individuals (albeit mostly wealthy ones) without legal due process and imposing punishments retroactively.

657,What are the political challenges in defeating organized crime?,NEGATIVE,"Fighting organized crime is in the best interests of everybody and after all, for politicians, less crime will make your electorate happier. On the other hand, countries have been wildly unsuccessful in getting rid of it. For example, see the FBI report on Italian organized crime: We estimate the four groups have approximately 25,000 members total, with 250,000 affiliates worldwide. There are more than 3,000 members and affiliates in the U.S., scattered mostly throughout the major cities in the Northeast, the Midwest, California, and the South. Their largest presence centers around New York, southern New Jersey, and Philadelphia. Given that we have been battling organized crime for almost 100 years now, it seems odd that crime is prospering instead of shrinking. I understand that there are law enforcement issues, that it is a tough job, etc. But this question is not about that. Is there a lack of political efficacy - if not political will - in solving this issue once and for all? What are the real challenges politicians face? Fear of retribution? Corruption? Plain incompetence? What is (politically) preventing this issue from being solved?"

660,"",NEGATIVE,"First We should differentiate two systems which are usually confused: The Republic and The Democracy. By the Aristotelian conception of the Politic Systems there are 3 fundamental political systems: the monarchy, the aristocracy and the republic, with their 3 corruption forms: the tyranny, the oligarchy and the democracy. The republic has in common with the democracy the kind of government (to all), this means that in theory the basis for the republic and the democracy is to govern for everyone, the difference is how this thing is done. The democracy is a politeia where the interest for everybody is sacrificed by a fraction, J. de Romilly, The basements of the democracy (Problémes de la démocratie grecque). When the mass governs for the common interest, the regime receives the common name for all government ways: the republic (politeia), Aristotle, Pol. 1279. What we conclude is that several of the government established around the world aren't Republics they are democracies or pseudo-democracies, and i say pseudo-democracies because the majority (the poor) are which choose the politicians, and several of the liberties, rights, taxes, and others aspects of the society are controlled by this \"people\" or fraction of it and many of these policies aren't directed for the common benefit but they are for the majority benefit, so the democracy at the end is converted into Ochlocracy. These problems you have seen in the \"democracy\" were seem by Aristotle and after by Polybius, but in our more advanced society more have spread, like: Demagogic policies, How many times we have seen politicians saying things like \"the wealthy are guilty of the people poverty\", or talking about the 2013 US fiscal Cliff agreement \"the wealthy have to pay more taxes to finance the people health services\", for me those are populist and demagogic tactics to gain more voters, because they know that the democracy is controlled by the mob. Degradation of the Representative System into a Bi-party System (the blue against the red, or the right vs the left, etc), and this happens cause the rational ignorance of the people, many people have a political conviction that is suppressed by the parties alliances. Raise of the corruption and favoritism, in some nations is common to see that government workers, and officers aren't chosen by their education or skills, they are pointed because their party's militancy or in some cases because their are family members of a high government officer. Impediment of candidature to capable and interested people because they don't fit some requirements implanted by the majority parties as millions of signatures, of high sums of money, and if they fit the requirements the media lobbies won't support most of the candidates because many of them are happy with the benefits given by big parties. Raise of unskilled persons into the government head by using the democracy's weaknesses (corruption or favoritism) destroying the economy. Or popular dictators as Adolf Hitler who used the democracy and transformed it into a tyranny. And I can continue with a very long list of \"democracy\" faults, some of this problems are solved by some innovative systems like the Demarchy. Demarchy (or lottocracy) is a form of government in which the state is governed by randomly selected decision makers who have been selected by sortition (lot) from a broadly inclusive pool of eligible citizens. These groups, sometimes termed \"policy juries\", \"citizens' juries\", or \"consensus conferences\", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that juries decide criminal cases. Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional representative democracy, which is widely subject to manipulation by special interests and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. The Wikipedia, Demarchy."
661,"",NEGATIVE,"It depends on the country: Structural problems: In Russia, on the local level organized crime is strongly reputed to be linked with both government in general and law enforcement in particular. Happens on federal level as well. Given russia's \"freedom of speech\", most of the evidence is individual blogs, but everyone knows plenty of examples. Kind of hard for the government to fight itself. In many countries, there's corruption. Cops/prosecutors/politicians are paid to look the other way. Economics makes organized crime almost inevitable in any country not built on fully libertarian principles. Anytime you prohibit some product or activity or service legally which has a demand in society, you create an ecological niche for organized crime to cater to that demand. Witness Prohibition in USA - that was when Mafia in US became powerful, running alcohol. Lack of political will: Frequently, organized crime doesn't negatively affect many civilians. Aside from rare cases of collateral damage, most of the violence is within the criminal world [citation needed]. As such, people are theoretically against organized crime as a concept, but practically won't vote against a politician they like otherwise merely because of lack of success in eliminating organized crime. Which means no politician will ever put practical solutions on top of their priority list aside from making good soundbites. Economic costs: Given the somewhat low impact on regular citizens, the costs of fighting organized crime are not cheap enough to justify investing as much money as required. Practical difficulties: People are afraid to go against organized crime. IIRC, in Italy, there were many cases of mafia assassinating law enforcement and politicians opposing them a while back. Due to corruption, law enforcement may experience political pressure to back off People are afraid to give information on organized crime to authorities due to fear of retribution, both as witnesses and as arrestees (and low-income people also face the backwards carrot pressure - at least with Italian mafia in USA - that if you get caught and don't snitch, the mafia will take care of your family). Top level criminals are very successful at arranging things to be plausibly deniable. The fact that Al Capone was nabbed on tax evasion isn't a testament to how good IRS agents are/were - it's a testament to how excellent Capone was at avoiding being charged with any other of the numerous serious crimes he committed. Low level criminals are interchangeable cogs, and in low income societies there are always enough to take place in the organization after someone else gets taken out of the game by law enforcement."

Are there any notable proposals to implement plural voting in modern times aside from \"parental vote\" model listed on the Wikipedia page? (\"notable\" for me is defined fairly liberally. Let's say, more than 1,000 people signed on to support you, or more than 50,000 people are aware of the proposal. As opposed to a blog post read by 10 people)."
667,What are the reasons against plural voting?,NEGATIVE,"Plural voting is the practice whereby one person might be able to vote multiple times in an election. It used to exist historically (see Wiki) but was generally abandoned. It seems that modern political thinkers uniformly consider it a bad idea, from left to right, from most libertarian to most totalitarian/statist. What are the main arguments against Plural voting in light of the fact that we already, in pretty much every political system that exists, do not have a strict 1-person-1-vote rules? To paraphrase R.A. Heinlein, every society in history limited the franchise to some effect - for example, most modern democratic societies restrict franchise from persons underage, or frequently persons convicted of crimes. Therefore, conceptually, if two people already - as universally supported - don't necessarily have the same voting weight (you can have a vote taken away from you for presumably doing wrong to society), what is the moral/philosophical argument against having select people being given additional votes for presumably doing more than average for society? Merely \"everyone has the same weight\" doesn't pass intellectual muster due to existing situation where that is already not true."
668,"What legitimizes the Maoists in Nepal, now that the government has expired?",NEGATIVE,"According to this article in the Economist, Nepal's government has expired, and there isn't really a procedure in place to either call new elections or put in a new constitution. In May an assembly elected in 2008 to write a new democratic constitution lapsed without completing its task. That plunged the country into renewed crisis. The interim constitution has no provision for holding fresh elections, nor for replacing the government. At the time Mr Bhattarai called for fresh elections to be held on November 22nd. But the opposition parties refused to co-operate over the electoral arrangements, and the president rejected two government ordinances on election rules. Politics is polarised. Mr Yadav believes that as the poll date passes the government will have no legitimacy, and so must go. To critics of the Maoists, the party is undemocratic and threatening, responsible for sowing division in Nepali society. Mr Yadav is supposed to be neutral, but stands with these critics. Indeed supporters credit him with proving a more effective opposition than the weak and fractious Nepali Congress Party, to which he once belonged. The Maoists, who won the last election and have transformed themselves from a rural militia into a mainstream party, accuse critics of trying to thwart social changes that many voters demand. ... The president’s preferred solution is said to be to install a “neutral” government, possibly under the leadership of a former chief justice, to oversee elections. Mr Yadav appears to believe that such a move would be popular; and that the Maoists, who are committed to fresh elections, would have little choice but to go along. ... A precedent exists for Nepal’s precarious situation. In 2002 a prime minister failed to hold elections, causing the then ceremonial monarch to sack him. The king enjoyed brief and shallow public support. Four years and four royally appointed governments later, the monarchy was defeated by a mass street movement, ushering in a ceremonial presidency. Do not wish the chaos of the past decade on Nepal again This article, however, is now over a month and a half old. What has happened in Nepal since then to legitimize the government?"

If the Nepal's Constitution does not consider this case and so It doesn't have any prevision for it, the constituted powers starting with the judicial (Supreme Court in some countries) should declare about the subject, and create or describe a provisional process to renew the executive power. By the other hand Nepali people should not forget that in theory the sovereignty resides in the people, and all the powers (legislative, executive and judicial), the laws and even the constitution are submitted by this sovereignty, so if the previous assembly couldn't write a new constitution, then the people can establish (in different ways one is the democratic) a new assambly or renovate its members to write the new constitution."
670,"",NEGATIVE,"The checks and balances of the UK parliamentary system are very different from the US, but they do exist. No answer here is doing to do better than give a summary. The executive branch of the UK is essentially the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, together with some non-cabinet governmental posts. They are usually drawn from the majority party (or parties) in the House of Commons. However there is more separation than you would think in terms of powers. Executive functions continue even if parliament is suspended. There is a clear distinction between the powers given someone by virtue of their government office, and powers due to their election as an MP. And there are strict rules about separating government activities from parliamentary political activities. For all the talk about \"the most powerful man in the world\", a Prime Minister of the UK arguably has more power within their country than the US President does in his. They can for the most part appoint their cabinet, declare war and run the country without any form of approval or confirmation from parliament. The powers of the cabinet are quite wide. Moreover they have a huge degree of control over the legislative agenda. The vast majority of bills in parliament are introduced by the government, and opposition typically spends its time opposing the agenda of the government rather than pursuing their own. The main check on this is however an equally huge one. At any time parliament may introduce a 'vote of no confidence'. Such a motion is essentially a vote to fire the government. In US terms, this would be the equivalent of Congress being able to vote to oust the President whenever they wish. Clearly the Prime Minister can only govern with the support of the legislature, and it is this that prevents possible excesses by the government. The fact that the government is drawn from the legislature is unimportant - there are typically on a few tens of members of the government, and the legislature always outnumbers them."
671,"",NEGATIVE,"Why is the UK Government/Administration and House all rolled into one entity? The short answer is: because that's the way it's turned out. The UK's system of government has evolved over a long period of time, rather than being planned from the start, the way the US system was. Power started with the monarch, was later shared with the Lords, and then also shared with the Commons. Over time, Parliament (the Lords and Commons) took more and more power from the monarch. In the last century, the Commons also took away some of the Lords' powers. As for why members of the Government are drawn from the two houses of Parliament: the role of Prime Minister evolved because the monarch needed someone who could get things done (and in the case, of the first person to be referred to as PM, who could also speak English), and this meant being able to have sufficient support in Parliament to pass laws. The head of the majority party in the house is the prime minister making him the head of government/administration. Why not have a separate administration/government and house such as happens in America? The British system came first, and has proven to be effective in a number of countries, so why change? If you're asking what checks and balances there are in this system, then it's true that a government with a large majority in the Commons could, in theory, do what it wanted, including making drastic changes to the constitution."

Over a 20-year timeframe, what would the net cost savings likely be? I am not asking the questions of whether the USA should adopt the metric system, or is likely to do so even if it's a good idea. I'm interested in the net cost. I'm open to other timeframes than 20 years. If someone has done a study with a 5-year or 30-year horizon, that is also interesting. I picked 20 years to allow for several years of switching costs, and then a good long time for benefits to become apparent. Clearly it's possible that the benefits might never outweigh the costs. In that case the \"net cost savings\" would be negative. I imagine studies have been done on this. Canada is a similar economy and culture, which went metric (mostly and officially) during the 1980s, so that might be a good comparison."

681,"",NEGATIVE,"As far as I can tell, this information does not actually exist in the form that the question requests. However, an analysis of the demographics of the group in question can lead to some reasonable conclusions. In general, the 47% are chiefly made up of two groups of people: the poor and the elderly. First, lets look at the poor: According to the Tax Policy Center, about half of those who owe no federal income tax are people whose incomes are so low that when standard income tax provisions — personal exemptions for taxpayers and dependents and the standard deduction — are factored in, that simply leaves no income to be taxed. Those are people who earned less than about $27,000. [1] The Census Bureau numbers tell us that this group has a clear Democrat party tilt, but it is not by any means exclusively Democrat: In 2008, when voter turnout rates were at or around record highs, fewer than half (44.9 percent) of adults in households making less than $30,000 per year voted, according to Census Bureau data. And of those who did vote, a substantial chunk voted for John McCain, the Republican candidate: 25 percent of those making under $15,000, and 37 percent of those making $15,000 to $30,000. [2] Of the other half of the 47% who made enough to owe federal income taxes after taking the standard deductions, but still owed no federal taxes due to some combination of other tax credits, 44% of them are elderly. From the Tax Policy Center: (source: taxpolicycenter.org) This group traditionally votes Republican and in far higher numbers than the group making less than $27,000 a year. The quote below is from a September 2012 article: In 2008, 70.2 percent of people over age 65 voted, according to the Census Bureau. And in that election, older voters supported John McCain over President Obama by an eight-percentage-point margin, with 53 percent voting for Mr. McCain. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, conducted last week, showed likely voters in the same age group supporting Mr. Romney by a 15-point margin – even wider than the gap on Election Day 2008. [2] Of the remaining 56% of people who receive some tax credit that results in a net zero federal tax liability a full 30% receive credits for children and the working poor. These people by definition only make enough to hover around the poverty line and like the first group discussed here can be expected to vote heavily, though not exclusively for the Democrat party. This data is certainly not sufficient to make projections on the voting habits of the group at large, but it certainly shows that there is something approaching parity between the two parties amongst this group. So given the 6 point win for Obama in 2012, it seems that the votes that \"put him over the top\" as @Affable Geek rightly calls it were the groups he won by decidedly larger chunks (i.e. blacks, Hispanics, Asians, younger voters and women), rather than a specific economic group: But he carried a whopping 93% of black voters (representing 13% of the electorate), 71% of Latinos (representing 10%), and also 73% of Asians (3%). What’s more, despite all the predictions that youth turnout would be down, voters 18-29 made up 19% of last night’s voting population -- up from 18% four years ago -- and President Obama took 60% from that group.

And technically taxes didn't go up as a result of the deal, the taxes were scheduled to go up anyway as part of last year's deal. If this deal hadn't passed, taxes would have gone up a lot more.

The top rate on ordinary income such as wages for joint filers earning more than $450,000 ($400,000 for single filers) would rise to 39.6%. Investment tax rates. For joint filers with income above $450,000 ($400,000 single), the top rate on long-term capital gains and dividends would rise to 20% from 15%. PEP and Pease provisions.

687,"",NEGATIVE,"Because to do so would cause a constitutional crisis. As the Wikipedia article on the subject lists, previous such crises have more typically been caused by the head of state acting against the advice of the government on matters such as dissolving Parliament, or dismissing or appointing Prime Ministers. However, the underlying issue is the same: in countries and states which have this system of government, where the head of state is expected to exercise what limited powers he or she has only on the advice of the government, when he or she doesn't, it can result in any of: fierce debate, governmental paralysis, fresh elections, a change in the constitution, the removal of the head of state (or the head of the head of state), or civil war. In the UK and other constitutional monarchies, as well as in a number of Commonwealth countries and their constituent states, constitutional convention dictates that the Queen (or equivalent in other countries and states) is required to assent to bills presented to him or her after they have been agreed to by the legislature. Although this power appears ceremonial, and in the vast majority of cases the Queen (or equivalent) does indeed grant assent when requested to do so, the power is real. This is demonstrated on the rare occasion when assent has been refused. To give one such example relating to King Baudouin of Belgium: In 1990, when a law ... liberalising Belgium's abortion laws, was approved by Parliament, he refused to give Royal Assent to the bill. This was unprecedented; although Baudoin was nominally Belgium's chief executive, Royal Assent has long been a formality (as is the case in most constitutional and popular monarchies). However, due to his religious convictions, Baudouin asked the Government to declare him temporarily unable to reign so that he could avoid signing the measure into law. The Government ... complied with his request on 4 April 1990. According to the provisions of the Belgian Constitution, in the event the King is temporarily unable to reign, the Government as a whole fulfils the role of Head of State. All members of the Government signed the bill, and the next day (5 April 1990) the Government declared that Baudouin was capable of reigning again. UPDATE 24 Jan '13: The Queen and Price of Wales (the heir to the throne) also have to give their consent to bills which relate \"to royal powers and the interests of the Crown and the Duchy of Cornwall\", and this must be done during the bill's passage through Parliament. As with Royal Assent, this is largely a formality. However, recently revealed documents show that the Queen did in fact refuse consent on a Private Members Bill in 1999, as well as on a few other instances prior to that. While this may look like the Queen vetoing bills she didn't like, it appears that it was actually the government using a rarely-used power to prevent inconvenient bills from being discussed in Parliament."
688,Which US states give proportional Presidential electoral college votes to candidates?,NEGATIVE,"The US Presidential election uses an \"electoral college\" system, where each state gets a certain number of \"electors\" (votes), and those electors cast the official votes for President. Each state's law determines how those electors are selected, and which candidate they vote for. Some states are \"proportional\", giving a candidate a percentage of electoral votes based upon their percentage of the popular vote. Some states are \"winner take all\", giving all electoral college votes in that state to the candidate that wins the most popular votes from that state. Which states are the former? In the recent 2012 election, if all states had switched to \"proportional\" allocation of electoral votes, what effect would that have had on the outcome?"
689,"",NEGATIVE,"There are two ways this can be done. Neither is in the interest of the state to do so. 1. A True Proportional Allocation of Electoral Votes Scenario: Electoral votes are apportioned according to the popular vote, with the winner getting the \"round up.\" e.g. A state with 10 electoral votes splits 53% - 47%. The winner gets 6, the loser gets 4. (Alternatively, you could go 5-5, but this makes it even worse!) Colorado came the closest to doing this back in 2004, but abandoned it for a pretty good reason - going to proportional representation in electoral college votes almost guarantees that your state will be ignored. The article even says as much: \"For the first state to do this unilaterally, we go way down in importance,\" said Dave Kopel, research director at the conservative Independence Institute in Golden. \"Because there's not much to gain ... a candidate would be nuts to spend time in Colorado.\" Imagine, for example, a state with 10 electoral votes, apportioned according to the popular vote. Now, let's take the case of Alaska, which, according Nate Silver, saw the most dramatic swing from the 2008 election to 2012. (In the case of Alaska, the reason is pretty obvious - Sarah Palin's involvement in the election took a normally solidly republican state, and made it extremely Republican.) This most dramatic swing of the state represented a change of 28%. In our hypothetical state with 10 electoral votes, this would represent a swing of 3 electoral votes - maybe going from say 9-1 to 6-4. That represents the top end of a state. Putting as much time and effort into the state yields, at most, 3 votes. If any other state doesn't do this, that state is worth 10 votes, just for swaying a few people. From an effort perspective, that state isn't worth campaigining in. Now, again, Alaska in reality, only has 3 electoral votes. Thus, even with such a dramatic swing, 28% is less than 1 elector. As such, just about every 3 vote state will always split 2-1. And, in just about every one of the 3-vote states, it almost always goes in the same direction. And, just to add insult to injury, remember that a blowout election is 60 - 40. Outside of the People's Republic of Washington, DC, getting more than 65% for any one party is well nigh impossible. So, again, in our hypothetical 10 vote state - what does a blow out get you? One, maybe, just maybe two votes. Again, compared to an all-or-nothing state, your votes just aren't worth that much. In 2012, Obama won 26 states, and as such, would have been the winner, albeit by a much smaller majority in the Electoral College. With such a minor return for such a major investment, a candidate has thus very, very little incentive to expend effort in such a state. It would be as if we went to a strict popular vote - why then would candidates bother with rural voters when courting their concentrated city cousins has much more result for the effort. 2. Congressional District Apportionment Scenario: Winner of each Congressional District gets 1 electoral vote, and the winner of the state gets the remaining two electoral votes e.g. Maine &amp; Nebraska Note: I don't consider this to be proportional, but apparently others do. As such, I'm addressing it. Overall, the commentary above holds true - going to such a scenario makes any effort in the state less desirable. Unlike the \"9 battleground states\" of 2012, you get the \"35\" (of 435) competitive house districts. Again, as Nate Silver shows, the number of congressional districts where the opposition party has a real chance has been narrowing dramatically. In 1992, there were 103 seats that could have swung either way. In 2012, there were 35. Safe districts (for better or worse as @DjClayworth points out) simply don't get the attention. Likewise, one of the defects of a popular vote system (corrected by the Electoral College) is that rural votes don't get a lot of attention for the same reason. (If you have a choice of reaching 100,000 voters by buying ads in one TV market or ten, where are you going to buy?) In practice, neither Maine nor Nebraska saw a lot of activity during the 2012 campaign. And, even though Obama won NB 2 in 2008, his campaign was unwilling to expend major resources there in 2012 - again ignoring it. Looking at the results of 2012, assuming that the popular vote was unchanged, but that every congressional district voted according to the party of its member of Congress (not entirely valid, but the best proxy I could come up with) Obama would have lost, 256 - 282 The methodology is as follows: Assign 2 electoral votes for the winner of the popular vote in each state - Obama 52, Romney 48 Assign each Congressional District according to its winner - Obama 200, Romney 234. Assign all three votes for DC to Obama Assign Jesse Jackson, Jr's vacant seat to Obama Romney = 48+234 = 282 Obama = 52+200+3+1 = 256 There are 9 states where the Presidential pick differs from the congressional delegation: Colorado Florida Iowa (tied 2 – 2) Michigan Nevada (tied 2-2) New Jersey (tied 6 – 6) Ohio (12 – 4) Virginia Wisconsin Interestingly, this exactly corresponds to the \"battleground states\" of 2012. Update Using the Daily Kos analysis of presidential preference by Congressional District, we can get actual 2012 results: Obama won 205 congressional districts, Romney 230 Again, allocating 52 state popular winner votes to Obama, 48 to Romney And, allocate DC's 3 to Obama, we get... Obama loses to Romney 260 - 278 Interestingly, that is within 8 votes of being the exact opposite result as 2012. Obama still would have beat McCain 291 - 247, however, in 2008. tld;dr> The point here is pretty simple - going to a proportional system guarantees that your state is either no longer in play or not really worth the effort. (So you push 1 vote in a state. Big deal!) Because of this, going to such a system simply reduces the impact of a state in an election, and is therefore not in the interest of the state to do. A ME/NB result looks to favor Republicans, however. This is due to the fact that rural voters tend to be more conservative, and are perhaps, over-represented strictly based on population."
691,Is the PATRIOT ACT constitutional?,NEGATIVE,"As noted by multiple civil libertarian groups, the PATRIOT ACT and its associated laws authorize the government to conduct courts in which the interpretation is not made public, and searches may be authorized without presenting the suspect with a warrant. Is this permissible under the Constitution? Specifically, what precedent is available on the topics of due process and search and seizure that may inform a court's decision should they take a case challenging the act? Edit: The parts I am most concerned with are sections 213 (Sneak and Peek), 215 (Access to records), and 218 (Reduced Wiretap Requirements). Although I find many other sections questionable, in the interest of keeping the question fully answerable, I am limiting my choices to these three."
693,"",NEGATIVE,"The most recent precedent from the Court on this issue comes in the form of District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago which were decided in 2008 and 2010 respectively. The holding in each case was substantively similar as McDonald primarily served to incorporate the 2nd Amendment via the 14th Amendment (since Heller applied to the District of Columbia only which is governed by the federal government directly) to the states and did not really set new gun ownership precedent. Heller dealt with a strict District of Columbia law that banned ownership of any handgun in the district and also required that any gun (even rifles and shotguns) should be kept unloaded and under the control of a trigger lock at all times when not in use. The Court's ruling went as follows: The clause \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State\" is merely colorful language and has no legal meaning. It does not expand or limit the scope of the following clause, which should be taken on its own. The right to bear arms as stated in the Second Amendment is not unlimited. Congress has the right to limit the manner and intent that they are used. Indeed, the Court upholds prohibitions on felons and the mentally ill owning guns explicitly in the decision. Handguns are \"arms\" for the purposes of the 2nd Amendment. Since there are lawful uses of arms (as described in the 2nd Amendment - i.e. the natural right of defense) no class of arms can be arbitrarily banned in all cases and for all uses. The requirement that all guns be unloaded, disassembled and/or under the control of a trigger lock while not in use has a direct, negative, effect on a legitimate lawful use of a protected \"arm\". As such, Congress does not have even a rational basis to implement this particular type of limitation on gun ownership. In McDonald the Court extrapolated these same requirements to the states. Importantly, the Court did not overturn existing precedent that some in the camp favoring a limit to gun ownership rights point to as an indication that the militia clause is important, but rather found a way to uphold that precedent by clarifying its interpretation. In United States v. Miller the Court upheld limits in the type of legal firearms found in the National Firearms Act of 1934 (specifically fully automatic rifles and short-barreled shotguns) because they would not be needed by a well regulated militia to efficiently carry out their duties. However, the Court explained in Heller that the Miller precedent from 1939 is the same precedent at work in Heller in 2008. This is because the Court in Miller was not claiming that a well regulated militia is required for gun ownership, but rather that it can be used as a guide as to the appropriate manner and intent of individual gun ownership. That the Court squared their ruling in Heller with the existing precedent in Miller, that could be seen to underline the importance of the militia clause, the Court actually broadened the ruling in Heller even further than it otherwise would have been if it just overturned the ruling in Miller. Applying this precedent going forward is squarely a job for the Supreme Court because even though some limitations on gun ownership might seem directly in line with the Court's thinking in Heller those specific provisions will still need to undergo at least a rational basis test on its own merits. For example, this reasoning might sound like it would support the limiting of high capacity magazines as has been recently discussed in the media because it would not be required for a militia to efficiently perform its duties (Miller) and is only a limit on the manner and intent of the use of otherwise legal arms (Heller). However, Congress would have to demonstrate at least a rational basis (perhaps even more in the view of the Court at that time) to justify the law and that interpretation will need to be made by the Court at that time on its individual merits. Until that day, this existing case law is the best guide we have for projecting the viability of future gun laws."
694,"Have any of the \"We the People\" petitions ever resulted in policy changes?",NEGATIVE,"I was looking at the U.S. White House's \"We the People\" petition website they had set up shortly after Obama took office, and noticed that most of the petitions are in the ridiculous or at least not feasible category. I see there are responses to the petitions, but many aren't policy changes, such as the \"White House beer recipe\". And some like this one state things like \"DHS is preparing a proposed rule\" that seem to indicate that some action might be taken, or maybe has been taken by now, but it's not clear if anything has actually happened yet. Have any petitions submitted through this website actually resulted in policy change (excluding super trivial changes), or resulted in any new legislation being introduced, voted on, and put into law?"
696,"",NEGATIVE,"Comparing presidential systems like the US with parliamentary systems like Australia is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. So to attempt to answer the question, it might be useful to provide some context: It could be argued that all democratically-elected positions have maximum term lengths, but that some have mechanisms that allow elections to be held earlier than originally scheduled. So, for most parliaments, a maximum term length is specified, but a general election can be called early if the government loses a confidence vote, or (in some countries and states) the prime minister (or equivalent) requests it. For other elections, there may be an equivalent of a confidence vote (e.g. a petition to hold a recall election), or rules that require an election to be held if an office-holder dies or resigns (as in many legislatures). In the US, there is no equivalent of a confidence vote because the government does not sit in Congress, as is the case in parliamentary systems, so US general elections can never be held early, and hence are always fixed terms. So to actually get back to the original question: I would interpret \"fixed terms\" in this sense as only applying to a parliamentary system which does not allow early general elections. Allowing the Prime Minister to call an early election means that the government can choose a time when it is popular in the polls, rather than waiting for the end of its term, when it may not be so popular. Whether you regard this as a good thing or not depends on whether you support the current government! Conversely, not allowing the Prime Minister to do this takes the politics out of things, and allows all parties (including the government) to plan ahead with some certainty. Most parliaments still allow early general elections if the government loses a confidence vote. The rationale is that, if no party is able to reliably win votes in parliament, they have little chance of convincing parliament to agree to their budget, which is considered an essential part of being a government."
700,How far does in loco parentis extend for schools in the United States?,NEGATIVE,"To my personal opinion, In the United States schools have adopted the position that they have in loco parentis authority over students, at the moment the students leave the company of their parents. The term in loco parentis, Latin for \"in the place of a parent\"\" refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent. Originally derived from English common law, it is applied in two separate areas of the law. First, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' civil liberties. Second, this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent. Courts generally have upheld in loco parentis claims by the schools on campus, but: Are there legal arguments for and against schools using in loco parentis off campus?"

702,"",NEGATIVE,"A constitution is a framework for government, and serves as a set of founding principles for the entity."
703,"",NEGATIVE,"Legal Dictionary has a good overview of the subject, and references case law. 'In place of parent,' schools were given broad powers to control the rights, punishments, and responsiblities of their students. By far the most common usage of in loco parentis relates to teachers and students. For hundreds of years, the English common-law concept shaped the rights and responsibilities of public school teachers: until the late nineteenth century, their legal authority over students was as broad as that of parents. Changes in U.S. education, concurrent with a broader reading by courts of the rights of students, began bringing the concept into disrepute by the 1960s. Cultural changes, however, brought a resurgence of the doctrine in the twenty-first century. One Supreme Court ruling found that students off campus behavior could be controlled: In dismissing a claim by a restaurant owner against a college, the Kentucky Supreme Court found that a college's duties under in loco parentis gave it the power to forbid students to patronize the restaurant (Gott v. Berea College, 156 Ky. 376, 161 S.W. 204 [1913]). This pretty much ended during the free speech movement, that began on college campuses like Berkeley. the landmark Dixon v. Alabama State Board of Education, 294 F.2d 150 (5th Cir. 1961). In Dixon, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit extended DUE PROCESS rights to students at tax-supported colleges, ruling that the Constitution 'requires notice and some opportunity for hearing' before students can be expelled for misconduct. After Dixon, courts largely turned to contract law for adjudicating disputes between students and their institutions. It still isn't clear exactly how far free speech extends for students. Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District found that students don't lose their First Amendment rights unless unless their speech is disruptive or infringes on the rights of others. They decided that black ARM bands to protest the Vietnam war were not disruptive. In Morse v. Frederick, a student was suspended for a banner at an off-campus event that read 'BONG HiTS 4 JESUS.' The court ruled in favor of the school, concluding that: school officials did not violate the First Amendment. To do so, he made three legal determinations: first, that 'school speech' doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred 'at a school event'; second, that the speech was 'reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use'; and third, that a principal may legally restrict that speech—based on the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's 'important—indeed, perhaps compelling interest' in deterring drug use by students. To further confuse the issue, the Third and Fourth district courts have differing rulings that the Supreme Court has decided not to hear. In a pair of Pennsylvania cases, an appeals court upheld the right of two students to create fake MySpace profiles ridiculing their principals. Justin Layshock created a profile mocking Hickory High School principal Eric Trosch in 2005. an eighth-grade student at Blue Mountain Middle School created a fake profile in 2007 for her principal, James McGonigle. [...] The profile claimed McGonigle liked to have sex in his office and hit on students and parents. [...] The mother, Terry Snyder, sued on her daughter’s behalf, claiming the punishment violated the First Amendment. In June 2011, the Third Circuit agreed. The above cases seems in direct conflict with thus ruling: Kara Kowalski, then a senior at Musselman High School in West Virginia, who created a group on MySpace in 2005. The was called “S.A.S.H.” and featured the tagline “No No Herpes, We don’t want no herpes.” Kowalski claims the group is an acronym for “Students Against Sluts Herpes,” and was designed to bring awareness to sexually transmitted diseases. Others believe it stood for “Students Against Shay’s Herpes,” referring to “Shay N.” – a fellow student at Musselman. Kowalski ultimately received a five-day, out-of-school suspension, [...] Kowalski sued, claiming the discipline violated her right to free speech, but in July 2011 the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the punishment."
704,"",NEGATIVE,"Let us first ask what are the implications of tactical voting? The main implication is that to obtain the best possible result you should vote tactically, but this is discriminatory against everybody voting sincerely. Voting sincerely for somebody who is already known will not win is equivalent to throwing away your vote. Additionally, anybody having more information about the likely result can make a better decision about who to vote. Both these properties are undemocratic, as they arbitrarily advantage certain groups of people. Furthermore, tactical voting paves the way for self fulfilling prophecies. If two parties or candidates target the same electoral base, they can try to convince the public that they have an electoral advantage (for example by publishing fake forecasts) and convince the voters that if they vote for the other candidate they are throwing away their vote. In brief, it is desirable that when a voter votes, the only information he uses is who he wants to win, not what he things other people will vote. This latter information is not interesting for determining the best and preferred candidate; in the best case it complicates the system, but in virtual all real cases it can change the outcome, and it will do this to the disadvantage to honest voters -- voters that were not able to correctly predict other voters behavior -- and to the disadvantage of candidates that where perceived to be unlikely to gain enough support (while possibly actually being liked by many)."
706,Why are US laws written in such convoluted formats?,NEGATIVE,"In recent times, the fiscal cliff has become a hot topic in the United States, and its resolution was applauded by both parties in Congress. However, upon reading parts of the actual American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, I realized that many of these bills are extremely complex in nature, not due to content, but in the way that content is presented. In particular, these bills consist of \"strike this from here\" and \"add this to there\" clauses which makes following the actual logic and flow of American law extremely difficult. Is there a particular reason why these laws are unreadable to the common citizen? Other examples: Hatch Act Modernization Act of 2012 Child Protection Act of 2012"
707,"",NEGATIVE,"When a law is passed, they are typically valid forever. There are obvious exceptions to this, the Bush era tax cuts that were set to expire after 10 years (but were extended until January 1, 2013) are an obvious recent example. However, the vast majority of laws are passed with no horizon and will continue to be in effect forever. Over the course of nearly 250 years of laws the sphere of human experience that has not been legislated in some way becomes increasingly small and as a result most modern law primarily changes existing law to comport to a new policy. Tax law is a good example of this. Modern Congresses pass numerous complex tax instruments every year (estate taxes, capital gains taxes, child tax credit, etc.) that would never have been envisioned when the tax system was put in place. However, the system itself has been in place since very near the founding of the country, so the proper way to implement these new policies is to modify that existing law."
709,"",NEGATIVE,"I encourage you to read Lawrence Lessig's 'Republic Lost'. As a general rule, the reason why American laws are so convoluted is because lobbyists write them and pack them with pork.

710,"",NEGATIVE,"A lot of the time, new legislation is not intended to create new laws, but to make changes to (amend) existing ones. This is useful because, when looking at the new legislation, it makes it clear precisely what is being changed. Parts of the old law that are not being changed don't need to be mentioned in the new one, and so don't need to be debated or voted on. The downside to this, as the question notes, is that the new legislation is difficult to read, and makes no sense unless you also have access to the law being amended. It's not just US legislation that is like this! It's common in British law too. For example, every year, the government changes the taxes on alcoholic drinks. The taxes were created by a law passed in 1979. They only want to change the numbers, nothing else, so section 186 of this year's Finance Act looks like this: 186 Rates of alcoholic liquor duties (1)ALDA 1979 is amended as follows. (2)In section 5 (rate of duty on spirits), for “£25.52” substitute “£26.81”. (3)In section 36(1AA) (rates of general beer duty)— (a)in paragraph (za) (rate of duty on lower strength beer), for “£9.29” substitute “£9.76”, and (b)in paragraph (a) (standard rate of duty on beer), for “£18.57” substitute “£19.51”. (4)In section 37(4) (rate of high strength beer duty), for “£4.64” substitute “£4.88”. (5)In section 62(1A) (rates of duty on cider)— (a)in paragraph (a) (rate of duty per hectolitre on sparkling cider of a strength exceeding 5.5 per cent), for “£233.55” substitute “£245.32”, (b)in paragraph (b) (rate of duty per hectolitre on cider of a strength exceeding 7.5 per cent which is not sparkling cider), for “£53.84” substitute “£56.55”, and (c)in paragraph (c) (rate of duty per hectolitre in any other case), for “£35.87” substitute “£37.68”.

Now, how do you get these estimates? Most people get them from the media. And this is the problem: if you own the media, you can manipulate the election estimates, which lets you indirectly manipulate the tactical votes of citizens. Such a manipulation can easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you make everyone believe that \"X has no chance of winning, because only 1% of people would vote for X\", many people will vote strategically for Y... and at the end you may be actually proven right, because only 1% of people will vote for X.

If you don't confine the question to current, UN-recognized countries: Mosuo (an ethnic minority in China) do not have traditional marriages. USA as a state wasn't terribly involved with marriages on a legal level at early stages. In UK, same was true before The Marriage Act (1753)."
724,Would Third Party Candidates in the United States fare better under a proportional representation split of electoral votes?,NEGATIVE,"One major difficulty in winning election as a third party candidate is the first-past-the-post , winner-take-all system of allocating votes in the electoral college. It tends to support a primary candidate and one challenger, but third party candidates have less ability to get elected. If the electoral college were proportional by state, however, would that increase the likelihood of electoral success for third party Presidential candidates?"
725,"",NEGATIVE,"In a word, no. The mechanics of the Electoral College are still designed to give a single candidate a mandate, and a necessary result of that is to marginalize third party candidates. An analysis of third party candidates will show why this is so difficult - Simply put, the margin to achieve an electoral vote anywhere is simply still very high. Let us look at the 2010 allocation of electoral votes. The minimum amount of votes needed to even get 1 electoral vote, outside of CA, TX, FL, and NY, is still pretty high: (State / Votes / % needed for 1 electoral vote) California 55 2% Texas 38 3% Florida 29 3% New York 29 3% Illinois 20 5% Pennsylvania 20 5% Ohio 18 6% Georgia 16 6% Michigan 16 6% North Carolina 15 7% New Jersey 14 7% Virginia 13 8% To put this in perspective, let us look at \"the 10 most successful third party candidates ever,\" according to this link. The top four entries, in my mind, do not apply: Abraham Lincoln (1860) – 39.8% Predates the 2 party system Theodore Roosevelt (1912) As a former President from a major party, 1912 was really just an intra-party fight that went to the general election. William Jennings Bryan (1896) – 45.8% My personal hero, alas, he was the nominee of a major party and of two third parties. Millard Fillmore (1856) A former president who also competed before the two party system. As such we really have: Ross Perot (1992) – 18.6% Probably would have earned votes in several states. Assuming equal support in all states, would have only received an electoral vote in states with more than 6 – That’s Utah &amp; up, so, yes, Perot would have gotten several electoral votes, but nowhere near a majority. Robert LaFollete (1924) – 16.6% Did win 13 electoral votes from Wisconsin, and yes, if support were more even distributed, could have received votes. George Wallace (1968) – 13.5% Did win 46 votes, mostly in the South. That said, his popularity was concentrated, which in the end, over represented his popular vote. Strom Thurmond (1948) – 2.4% Did win 39 electoral votes in 4 southern states. Also, w/Harry Byrd in 1960, 14 of 15 votes. Had his support not been so concentrated in the South, however, he wouldn't have gotten any. Now, we get to the also-rans, and the ones people generally think about: Ralph Nader (2000) – 2.74% Assuming equal distribution, could have only gotten 1 electoral vote in California. And that would be it. Ron Paul (2008) – 0.3% Would have gotten no electoral votes, even under this system. Now, arguably, you would have more of an incentive under a proportional system, but the numbers still bear out how exceedingly difficult being a third party candidate is in a Presidential election. The Electoral College ensures that a President is both deeply and widely acceptable. That's the point - and #3 will always find it difficult to do either, let alone both."
726,Is the abortion debate as divisive outside the US as it is inside?,NEGATIVE,"In the United States, abortion is a highly polarizing issue: We have political organizations with substantial influence on the major parties, it is a regular topic of debate amongst candidates (less so now than in the past, but it was still the focus of many ads in the last Presidential election), and it generally is a \"top-of-mind\" issue for many voters, at least when measured by polls that ask voters to list important issues to them. Outside of the United States, I'm aware that it is an issue - particularly in Catholic countries - but I'm not really clear on how important it is to voters. How would one characterize the level of debate in: Catholic Europe South America Non-Catholic Europe South Asia (India, etc..) Muslim areas and the rest of Africa?"
727,How would the trillion-dollar coin save the United States' economy?,VERY_NEGATIVE,"Recently I read in a news post that the Treasury Department is able to order the coinage of a coin made of platinum with a value of 1,000,000,000,000 USD, or 1 trillion US dollars. You can read about this subject The Trillion Dollar Coin Idea To Save The Economy(courtesy of Business Insider): The premise of the idea is this: Although the Treasury can't just create money out of thin air to pay its bills, there is a technicality in the law that says the Treasury has special discretion to create platinum coins of any denomination, and the thinking is that Tim Geithner could make the coin and walk it over to the Federal Reserve and deposit it in the Treasury's bank account. The opinion of the winner of the Economics prize in memory of Alfred Nobel Paul Krugman (Conscience of a Liberal, The Opinion Pages): First, as a legal matter the Federal government can’t just print money to pay its bills, with one peculiar exception. Instead, money has to be created by the Federal Reserve, which then puts it into circulation by buying Federal debt. You may say that this is an artificial distinction, because the Fed is effectively part of the government; but legally, the distinction matters, and the debt bought by the Fed counts against the debt ceiling. The peculiar exception is that clause allowing the Treasury to mint platinum coins in any denomination it chooses. Of course this was intended as a way to issue commemorative coins and stuff, not as a fiscal measure; but at least as I understand it, the letter of the law would allow Treasury to stamp out a platinum coin, say it’s worth a trillion dollars, and deposit it at the Fed — thereby avoiding the need to issue debt. My questions are: Is this legal? If I am not wrong, only the Fed has the power to print official money? Who will accept this coin, and how will this coin save the economy?"
728,"",NEGATIVE,"A trilion dollar coin isn't going to be very useful unless you can find an industry that regularly makes trillion or close to a trillion dollar transactions. Not only do you have to find someone who's going to sell you a trillion dollars worth of something, but in order for them to actually use the coin, they'll have to find someone else who wants to give them a trillion dollars worth of capital for it. On the other hand, if the Fed mints a trillion dollars worth of smaller detonations, that will cause the value of the dollar to go down, considering that there are a trillion more dollars."
729,"",NEGATIVE,"It depends how you define fare better. Most third party candidates are not truly viable candidates but a good third party candidate might pull enough electoral votes to prevent either of its competitors from achieving a majority of the electoral votes as is required by the constitution. This may be enough to spur the major parties to field good candidates for the country instead of fielding candidates that will be good for the party. Ross Perot, Gary Johnson, and Ralph Nader all had one thing in common. They were running because the major party candidates were (in their opinion) not good for the country. If their potential candidacy spurs better leaders to be chosen by their party, then many of the candidates , and their supporters, would say they fared better. Another potential is that the third party candidate may play spoiler getting just 30 or so electors. The electoral college will be required to get a majority (270 votes currently) vote for a single candidate. The electors are not required to vote for the person whom they elected to vote for. The electors could decide that since they will never get a majority of the votes for their candidate; and the third party candidate being preferable to the opposition candidate; the third party candidate could get elected despite having the last place total from election day."
730,"",NEGATIVE,"The purpose of the coin isn't to raise the amount of money in circulation, it's to alter the debt-load of the government, which prevents an un-raised debt ceiling from negatively impacting the economy. In Krugman's description, this is the key bit: First, as a legal matter the Federal government can’t just print money to pay its bills, with one peculiar exception. Instead, money has to be created by the Federal Reserve, which then puts it into circulation by buying Federal debt. You may say that this is an artificial distinction, because the Fed is effectively part of the government; but legally, the distinction matters, and the debt bought by the Fed counts against the debt ceiling. By making the coin, and depositing in the Federal Reserve, it means that the amount of money in existence has been drastically altered. However it's been done in a way that avoids buying Federal debt. So the government has more money to spend without having increased its debt load. The debt ceiling is a law where Congress authorizes the total amount of Federal debt. Normally, Congress just votes to increase this as a minor bureaucratic action (this is separate from the budget, which lays out how the government will spend money). During the most recent debt ceiling raise in late-2011, it became an issue. Since the debt ceiling is decoupled from the budget, the federal government is essentially ordered by Congress to spend money as allocated in the budget. In order to do this, the government borrows money to finance things. But if the debt ceiling isn't raised, then the federal government is essentially stuck unable to pay its bills because it can't borrow more money. So the trillion coin idea is a way to avoid hitting the debt ceiling without borrowing more money. There would likely be some economic impact to this, but since this it's never been done, it's not precisely known what the impact would be. On the other hand, we know the impact of a government shutdown, which is what would happen without a debt ceiling raise or a trillion dollar coin being minted."
731,"",NEGATIVE,"If you're willing to stretch the definition of plural voting a little: In elections to the City of London Corporation, the governing body of the City of London1, not only are companies and other organisations represented, but the number of voters they receive is dependent on the size of the organisation. This ranges from 1 voter for a body employing up to 9 people, to 79 voters for a body employing 3500 people, with organisations free to select their voters as they please. Sources: City of London Corporation website and Wikipedia. (Incidentally, if this does count as plural voting, so too would the US Electoral College...) (1) Not to be confused with London."
732,"",NEGATIVE,"It doesn't make much sense to me. Money is a measure of the amount of wealth of a country and printing this coin doesn't alter the wealth of the US. The effective value of one dollar is, in other words, the total wealth of the US, divided by the number of dollars in circulation. If they were to increase this number by 1 trillion, the value of each dollar in circulation will be decreased in inverse proportion, or, in other words, the \"value\" of this super-coin will be \"drained\" from the whole economy. The overall effect would be inflation. More info here"
733,"",NEGATIVE,"In very general terms, abortion is not a 'top of the mind' issue for voters in Europe. It's certainly a contentious social issue, as is everywhere, and different countries follow different approaches, but other than very specific examples it's not a frontline issue in European politics. I might be stating the obvious here, but abortion laws are not uniform in Europe or the European Union. That said, with the exception of Ireland and Malta, you can assume a 'available on request' approach with a minimum gestational limit of 12 weeks in the EU and most non EU countries, that is (broadly) similar to the US approach. BBC News has a very interesting map of Europe's abortion laws that gives a quick overview of related national regulations: While the above map might show a somewhat uniform approach, at least in the core countries of the EU, it doesn't really say much about the population's social acceptance of abortion, other than the fact that at some point in the past it was high enough for regulators to legalize the practice. Havas Worldwide (then Euro RSCG) commissioned a study on 'European values' in 2005 that included the question: If a woman doesn't want children, she should be able to have an abortion The results of the study showed varying support for abortion, with the exception of Poland1, the only country where the (slim) majority answered 'total no': This is just one study, but it includes the more populous countries and shows that public opinion is more or less on par with established policies and regulations. Ireland is the notable exception when it comes to abortion and politics, the Eight Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (7 October 1983) introduced a constitutional prohibition of abortion: The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. The ban was loosened up a bit by the Thirteenth and the Fourteenth Amendments, however the issue remains controversial in Ireland. In December 2010, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) found that Ireland had failed to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights Act in the Case of A, B, and C v. Ireland, while at the same time recognizing that Ireland was free to have whatever abortion laws it wants, provided they are clear, effective and accessible. Prior to the ruling, A, B, and C v. Ireland was quoted as a potential European equivalent to Roe v. Wade, but the ECtHR emphasized that the European Convention on Human Rights Act does not provide a straightforward right to abortion. Unfortunately, the lack of clarity on Ireland's abortion regulations identified by the ECtHR was put to the test in October 2012, with tragic results: Savita Halappanavar, who was 17 weeks pregnant, died of septicaemia a week after presenting with back pain on 21 October at University hospital in Galway, where she was found to be miscarrying. After the 31-year-old dentist was told that she was miscarrying, her husband reportedly said that she had asked for a medical termination a number of times over a three day period, during which she was in severe pain. But he said these requests were denied because a foetal heartbeat was still present and they were told at one point: 'This is a Catholic country.' Ms. Halappanavar's death re-started the abortion debate in Ireland, and to a lesser extend in Europe, and currently the majority opinion seems to be in favour of drastic reforms in the country's abortion policies that would bring Ireland closer to the rest of Europe when it comes to women's access to abortion. In conclusion and returning to your core question, I can't imagine the issue becoming as divisive as in the US even if public opinion was largely against abortions, at least not in the near future. I tried to get a better feeling of the state of the debate in the US, and I was both horrified and surprised when I stumbled upon the anti-abortion violence article on Wikipedia. If this is the level of tension you had in mind, then no, Europe is nowhere near that level of craziness when it comes to issues with religious overtones. 1 I'll venture a guess and say that Poles at the time were more open to the Catholic Church's view on the issue, given that the then Pope, John Paul II, was Polish."
735,"",NEGATIVE,"There is nothing wrong with plural voting, other than the fact that all historical occurrences of it on a national elections scale were designed to favour certain groups on questionable bases (white male property owners, for example). The concept of \"one person, one vote\" is a reaction to the unbalances of plural voting, and it's both a simpler and a fairer approach. The crucial difference between the two systems is that it is a lot easier for a society to judge whether a voter has been harmful to the society than to ascertain whether a voter is more valuable than average. Let's assume a simple election model, where citizens: Get one vote at age 18, and Are excluded from voting if incarcerated. The age requirement is an arbitrary limit, that has been challenged since at least the early 20th century. Demeny voting, if established, would be a very interesting mixture of the two systems, as at one hand minors would get a vote, furthering the \"one person, one vote\" concept, while at the same time their parents would get more than one vote. In any case, I'll ignore it as it was present, in one form or another, in all examples of plural voting, and it's not really a trait that separates the two systems. This leaves us with only one requirement for political franchise, a requirement that is very close to being objective, assuming of course we trust our model society's justice system. And if we don't, I think it's fair to say that the whole discussion is moot, we have bigger problems than our voting system. Similarly to a trusted justice system, other requirements that are commonly present in \"one person, one vote\" systems are based around trusted institutions, for example excluding mentally unstable citizens from voting would require that the population generally and overwhelmingly trust the society's health system. Now, imagine that our model society is trying to move on to plural voting, who'd get a second (or third or fourth) vote? If you manage to define \"doing more than average for society\" in a way that will be as clear as a trusted justice system and will not have certain groups of people calling for your head (on a platter), congratulations, we've successfully moved on to plural voting. Expect a riot in 6-8 weeks. Everyone having the same weight is a naive goal, \"one person, one vote\" is more a system of minimizing the potential for abuse than one of idealistic equality. I don't think plural voting would be considered a less democratic system, if we were able to come up with a balanced (or at least apparently balanced) and (mostly) frictionless way of determining who gets the extra votes, similarly to how forms of weighted voting are not generally considered undemocratic and are practised and widely accepted in several democratic countries and institutions. It's not an inherently wrong system, it's just unrealistic to believe that a society will overwhelmingly accept any method of measuring one's contributions to it."
736,What are the most known examples of weighed voting that are practiced in democratic countries?,NEGATIVE,From Yannis' answer to What are the reasons against plural voting?: ...similarly to how forms of weighted voting are not generally considered undemocratic and are practiced and widely accepted in several democratic countries and institutions. Question: What are the most known examples of weighed voting that are practiced in democratic countries?
737,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"Weighted voting is, simply put, a collective decision making process where votes are explicitly assigned unequal weights. It's actually a quite common approach in international bodies, notably followed in one form or another by: The European Parliament (degressive proportionality), The European Council (qualified majority voting), The International Monetary Fund, UN's Security Council. A less obvious example is proportional representation. Several countries that follow the approach for national elections also employ minimum election thresholds and/or plurality bonuses, to avoid extreme fragmentation and maximize the chance of electing a strong government respectively. Both are weighted voting elements, and adding a bit of history to the mix creates complex examples, like Cyprus: 56 members of the House of Representatives are elected by proportional representation, 24 seats are allocated to the Turkish community (but remain vacant since 1964), and 3 seats are allocated to the Armenian, Latin and Maronite minorities. Moving on, a perhaps more clear cut example on a national level is single transferable vote, the approach followed in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Malta, Australia (for electing the Senate), India (by state legislatures), and... Stack Exchange community moderator elections ;) Lastly, the US Electorate College is a prime example of weighted voting, disproportionally favouring the less populous states."

742,"",NEGATIVE,"Owning a media empire certainly helped him to jump start his political career in 1994 with his \"Discesa in campo\" televised address and spot campaign he could do for (basically) free at the time. His first government was not stable and fell in less than a year, so it is arguable that his media empire was little help in that instance&hellip; His second government though, has been the longest serving Italian cabinet post WWII. This is due, in first instance, to the political stability of his alliance. On the other hand the government fell at the end of legislature with less electoral favour than at the beginning: House of Freedoms did not do as well in the 2003 local elections as it did in the 2001 national elections. In common with many other European governing groups, in the 2004 elections of the European Parliament, gaining 43.37% support. Forza Italia's support was also reduced from 29.5% to 21.0% (in the 1999 European elections Forza Italia had 25.2%). So one could argue that he has not been on top of Italian politics, but merely one of the prominent figures. On the other hand, it is a well know fact that Berlusconi's media, such as one of his newspaper, orchestrated campaigns to \"hit\" perceived political enemies. One of the most notorious examples is the case of Emma Marcegaglia, where her company group would be targeted by the newspaper after she spoke against Berlusconi. The reasons of his success in Italian politics lie probably in his character and ability as a media person, a salesman and a media magnate. He clearly knows how to manipulate the media, and he is clearly a strong leader that people like to follow. Both these are strong reasons behind his success, but also in the entrepreneurial arena."
743,"",NEGATIVE,"In The Netherlands, the members of the Eerste Kamer are elected with a system where different votes have different weights. The Wikipedia article explains it only in Dutch. The Eerste Kamer (Upper House) are not elected directly by the people, but they are elected by the members of the provincial parliaments. Those provincial parliaments in turn are elected by the people. To compensate for the fact that not every province has the same number of inhabitants per parliamentarian, the votes for the Eerste Kamer have different weights depending on the province. Not every member of the States-Provincial has an equally weighing vote. By vote-weighing, a relation is created with the number of inhabitants of the province. The population is divided by one hundred times the number of States-Provincial members in the province. The result is called the stemwaarde. In Flevoland in 1995, for example, one vote had a stemwaarde of 61, whereas one in Zuid-Holland had a stemwaarde of 401. The votes for a particular party are multiplied by the stemwaarde. The result of this sum is the stemcijfer. For completion, the original Dutch text is: Niet elk Statenlid heeft een even zware stem. Door weging wordt een relatie gelegd met het inwonertal van de provincie. Het inwonertal wordt daarbij gedeeld door het honderdvoud van het aantal Statenleden van de provincie.

744,Has a government minted this much money at once before?,NEGATIVE,"There are discussions on the internet of a scheme by which the United States government could continue to function without raising the debt ceiling. This scheme boils down to the use of a loophole that would allow for a trillion dollar coin to be minted. I'm curious what the effects of such an act would be, but I'd like something grounded in history. Has any government minted this much money at once before? I'm not asking for a 1:1 match here given the large amount of currency we're dealing with, just a significant amount of money. For example, one trillion dollars is between 1/3 and 1/4 of US Federal Spending in 2011, so if a country has minted currency on a similar scale as 1/4th of the government's total spending, that's acceptable."

746,"Are there any notable Gay Rights groups advocating \"Get the Government out of marriage\" solution to same-sex marriage?",NEGATIVE,"One of the main arguments made in favor the of US (or non-US) Government recognizing same-sex marriage is the \"equality\" one - that heterosexual couples have unequal rights with same-sex couples in that the former can have their marriages recognized by the state and the latter can not, and such recognition confers rights and benefits. The solution seemingly uniformly advocated by Gay Rights groups is to adjust the rights to the \"high watermark\" to achieve equality - namely, for the government to recognize same-sex couples. Are there any notable Gay Rights groups that advocate the opposite solution (which is usually advocated by libertarian-ish crowd), of achieving equality by moving to \"low watermark\" - namely, having the government not recognize ANY marriage, same-sex or heterosexual - at all? (the practical implementation of such a solution is somewhat outside the scope of the question, but the usual proposed approach is 100% contract based). I will accept pretty much any definition of notability - someone with more than double-digits social media followers, someone whose position was covered by mainstream media or notable online news sources, general or LGBT specific, someone involved with politics or especially holding an elected office. UPDATE - I'm fine if the group in question words their position as \"we are happy with EITHER of the 2 watermarks equally\", e.g. as long as they view \"No government marriage\" just as valid a solution as \"same sex marriage recognized by the state\"; although if exists I'd rather like to know of a group for whom the first is the preferred option."
747,Hypothetical challenge to the 22nd Amendment,NEGATIVE,"What if, for whatever odd reason (disregarding the extreme unlikeliness of this ever happening), a two-term President of the United States was elected to a third term by popular write-in vote? What would happen? The laws don't seem to cover this so well (most likely because the probability of it happening approaches zero), but even if the law clearly rejected all votes for the third term, would the government be inclined to enforce it, the will of the people being that strongly opposed to the other offered choices?"
748,"",NEGATIVE,"Most likely, the following will happen: Each state's electoral voting rules will kick in. The write-in who is not eligible as a candidate will be treated on the ballots as each state's rules indicate - most likely, simply have those ballots discarded as invalid. There may be some state variations, e.g. when state has special rules that invalid name on a ballot counts as 'NONE' candidate, AND when something special needs to happen if 'NONE' wins over valid candidates. Either way, what will NOT happen, will be certifying that write-in person as a winner of any of the state's election. Each state's rules are different, here's an example from Georgia: 'However, because Darwin was not an officially registered write in candidate, the Georgia Secretary of State did not tabulate those votes'. As such, no electors will be pledged to such a write-in '3rd term' ineligible candidate, since the candidate will NOT, legally, have won in any of the states, all ballots with their name being invalid/empty. When the electors vote, one of two things will happen - either they will vote for someone else, or for the already-served-2-terms-write-in person (becoming mass faithless electors). Remember that the electors MAY choose to vote for whoever they decide, despite who they are pledged to (See Faithless elector) If the latter happens, their choice will be challenged in SCOTUS and likely declared invalid. As such, the 12th Amendment to the US Constitution will kick in: ...The person having the greatest Number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice-President shall act as President, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President. As an extra, if even after all the above barriers, an ineligible president is elected, Section 3 of the XX Amendment kicks in: .. if the President elect shall have failed to qualify [between Election Day and Inauguration Day], then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified; ... and the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified.”"

Looming government shutdowns seem to be a bit of a joke as read here, or on NPR Still, with so many federal agencies deemed essential, it's unclear whether most Americans will even notice if the government is shut down. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines \"essential\" government services and \"essential\" employees as those: Providing for the national security; Providing for benefit payments and the performance of contract obligations under no-year or multi-year or other funds remaining available for those purposes; Conducting essential activities to the extent that they protect life and property The OMB also requires that government agencies have a plan for what to do. The Clinton administration published some of the following as its estimates of the effects of the previous government shutdowns: Medicare: 400,000 newly eligible participants were delayed in enrolling. Social Security: Claims from 112,000 applicants were not processed. 212,000 new or replacement Social Security cards were not issued. 360,000 office visits were denied. 800,000 toll-free calls for information were not answered. State Department: 80,000 passport applications delayed. 80,000 visas delayed. The resulting postponement or cancellation of travel hurt US.. airlines, hotels and tourist industry. National Parks: 2 million visitors turned away from national museums and monuments. IRS Enforcement: The Treasury Department lost $400 million of revenue from the shutdown of the IRS Enforcement Division. Although the same article notes: Thus, most of the American public should not be terribly inconvenienced by a temporary federal government shutdown. Unfortunately, the people who will immediately feel the effects of the government shutdown are the hundreds of thousands of nonessential government employees who will be immediately furloughed. However, if history is any indication, they will not suffer lasting severe hardship since, as we previously noted, in the 1995 and 1996 shutdown, these nonessential government employees were eventually paid not to work.

For example: If we apply these rules to the current national debt, using this following assumptions: The minimum payment is interest + 1%-2%. Calculate for Public Debt held, and Intergovernmental Transfers. (separately , together, or both) The interest rate is constant and at the last known rate. Fill in the boxes (note: The first box contains the minimum payment and 3-year payoff amounts. The middle box contains the total years to pay off the debt paying only the minimum payment, and 3-years. The last box is the total cost of the debt after paying it off and the 3-year difference savings.)"

760,What are the practical effects of having too large a debt load?,NEGATIVE,"My understanding is that Japan has a debt-to-gdp ratio of approximately 200%. It is considered to be one of the worst in the world. The United States is only in the 100% range. What effects would be noticed in the economy and government of the United States if it were to creep into Japanese level styles? Is the \"lost decade\" (actually two) of Japan a consequence of this, or just merely a correlation?"
761,Does depreciation count in scoring a budget proposal?,NEGATIVE,"I'm going to be meeting with my Congressman soon about a modest proposal I have that could be a big deal. My Congressman (Frank Wolf) is a big proponent of telecommuting already, and is quite aware of all the great benefits that it brings. I want to bring to his attention (or rather his LA's attention) a simple idea that I have, modelled on the famous cubicle depreciation story. As you probably know, the cubicle - that Dilbertesque fate of the white collar worker - was tremendously helped in its adoption by a quirk of tax law. Renovations to offices are depreciated on a 30 year schedule, Cubicles on a much, much shorter time frame. Because cubicles can be depreciated faster, there is an incentive amongst corporations to use them - they realize the same tax benefit over a shorter period of time. Since \"revenue\" is thus accelerated, it spurs adoption. My idea is simple - any assets used primarily by a telecommuting worker (defined as someone who regularly works within 1 mile of their primary residence more than 3 days a week) would be depreciated over a period one class shorter than its normal designation. (Per Tax Code Section 147, assets can be depreciated over periods ranging from 18 months to 30 years). In presenting this proposal to the Congressman, however, I'd like to be able to say that the idea is actually revenue neutral over a 10 year period - the most common measure of scoring a program's cost. Would this be accurate? In general, is there any budgetary scoring cost for accelerating depreciation? While I'm most interested in the USA (and specifically CBO scoring), I'm up for foreign precedent as well."
762,What exactly do political aides do?,NEGATIVE,"Whenever you read about the history of any recent politician (or at least, American politicians) it says \"They were an aide in the Clinton administration\" or something similar. What exactly do these aides do? Clearly it's some sort of progression path to actually holding the office, and seems similar to the typical \"master/apprentice\" relationship that so many trades have had over the years. But what are the typical day to day duties of an \"aide\", and why are they so important?"
763,"",NEGATIVE,"Japan's sovereign debt was 65% of GDP in 1992 (the Lost Decade started in 1991). The rise to 200% was the consequences of trying to dig themselves out of the hole, not the cause of the lost decade. It would take a book (and did :) to list the reasons for the lost decade, but on a fundamental level, a large (not the only) part of the problem is the demographic bomb - Japan just didn't make enough children to produce in the economy as older workers retired and lived longer. Because of that, they could not achieve the economic growth needed to plug the deficit. Additional reasons are high savings rate (people kept buying government bond to save), middle-of-the-way monetary policy (which IIRC precipitated the infamous \"Helicopter\" Ben Bernanke speech giving him his nickname), and consequences of 1980s asset bubble.

765,Could the US legally adopt Indonesia's 'religion in schools' setup?,NEGATIVE,"There have been recent news stories about Indonesia's plan to increase religious teaching in schools. This intrigues me, as here in the United States, schools can't force students to worship specific religions. However, in Indonesia: Indonesia is a Muslim-majority country with a secular government that recognizes the rights of six different faiths, including Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism. Religion is taught to students according to their own faiths, meaning that Muslim students are instructed in Islam, while Christian students study Christianity in separate classes. Reflecting the country’s demographics, most religious instruction is Islamic. Would it be constitutional for public schools in the US to teach students the religion of their parents' choosing like this? The idea being that each child is taught the specific religion their parents designate. In my mind, this would require the schools to accept whatever religion the parents stated as preferred, including things like Jedi. I would think this might avoid violating the Free Exercise and Establishment clauses of the 1st Amendment by not having preferential treatment towards one, specific religion or small group of religions."
766,"Is it illegal for a U.S. government to put up a \"Christmas\" tree?",NEUTRAL,"I have occasionally heard that it may be illegal for a U.S. government to put up a \"Christmas\" tree. Is this true? If yes, what is the motivation for this? I have heard that separation between church and state might be interpreted as such in the USA (for example, a government-sponsored crucifix in a public school would be frowned upon), but as the religious nature of the \"Christmas\" tree itself is debatable, couldn't they just put up a tree with decorated lights without calling it a \"Christmas\" tree?"
767,"",NEGATIVE,"No, it's not illegal. The US Supreme Court has never been asked to rule on the legality of state-sanctioned christmas trees, but in Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU, it did rule that a crèche forming part of a christmas display which happened to also include a large christmas tree violated the Establishment Clause (and conversely that the inclusion of a menorah in the same display did not). In that opinion, the court did have this to say about trees: The Christmas tree, unlike the menorah, is not itself a religious symbol. Although Christmas trees once carried religious connotations, today they typify the secular celebration of Christmas.1 Indeed, the court concluded in that case that the inclusion of the tree in the display was a mitigating factor, reducing the likelihood that the menorah could be seen as an overt endorsement of religion. If they were illegal, presumably some enterprising member of Congress would have tried to impeach the President by now ..."
768,"",NEGATIVE,"I think this is referencing the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, rather than Arrow's Impossibility theorem. In any electoral system which elects a single winner from amongst three or more candidates, then the system is subject to tactical voting. Tactical voting is where e.g. the system says \"please vote for your favourite candidate\" but you vote for your second-favourite because doing so makes it more likely for your least favourite to lose. The formal definition is that if you know how everyone else is going to vote, there are circumstances where you switch your vote away from your sincere preference list and the winner will be someone higher up your preference list than it would be if you voted your sincere preferences. A good example of this is the Presidential election in Florida in 2000. Many voters voted for Ralph Nader; they would (mostly) have preferred Al Gore to George Bush, but they preferred Nader even more, so they voted for him. However, if they had voted for Gore (in spite of him actually being their second preference) then he would have won, and they would have got their second-best candidate, rather than their worst (well, Pat Buchanan ran in that election, so probably their second-worst in practice). In real-world elections, there are some systems where is is much harder to vote tactically than others - you never have perfect information on everyone else's vote, so the more information that you need to be able to vote tactically, the less likely people are to do so. Aside: technically, you can have systems that aren't subject to tactical voting. If you eliminate all but two candidates before the votes are counted (but after they are cast), then you reduce the remaining election to a two-candidate single-winner election. Of course, that means that a candidate that every single person voted for can lose. The actual proof shows that the only exceptions are a dictatorial system (i.e., one voter decides who wins) and a system where some candidates cannot win, even if everyone votes for them."
769,"",NEGATIVE,"Plural voting, where everyone gets the same number of votes (but that N≠1), just makes things more complicated without good reason. Sometimes, there is a good reason. For instance, you could have a vote where you live and another vote where you work (which vote you exercise in your home if you don't have an external occupation). This would have very little effect on national elections, but a huge effect on local ones; there are an awful lot of people who commute into major cities, use many local services, but have no influence over any local policies where they work."
770,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"There are several different \"none of these\" options that have been implemented. Many of them are only implemented in private elections (as distinct from public elections; e.g. elections within unions or student elections or internal elections in political parties). One is \"Re-Open Nominations\" (aka RON). If elected, then the nominations have to be re-opened and then the election re-run. Sometimes, those nominated the first time are ineligible to be nominated again. A second possible result is to create a casual vacancy (as if the elected person had died in office), which is then filled by the normal mechanism for filling a vacancy. If that normal mechanism is a by-election (US: special election) then this is effectively the same as RON*. But it may not be; for instance US Senators are elected, but vacancies are filled with appointment by the state's governor; the President is elected, but a vacancy is filled by the Vice-President; VP vacancies are filled by Presidential appointment and confirmation by both Houses of Congress. A third possible result is that the office will sit unfilled for one term and its powers cannot be exercised for that term. This is more common with elections to committees or parliaments than for executive office - the parliament is just one member short for a few years. In a primary election, the result of NOTA winning is usually that that party will not contest the election. In primaries that are closed, especially ones that are narrowly closed (like US caucuses, or French-style primaries that are only open to dues-paying members), the option not to contest the election may be used to concentrate the party's resources on particular elections. * There may be technical differences between a by-election and a rerun of the normal election. For example, in the UK, the expenditure limits are higher for by-elections than for re-run elections. In the US, different rules may apply for primary elections for a special election than apply for a general election, and not all states have rules for a rerun general election at all (reruns can apply if, for example, a candidate dies too late for their name to be removed from ballots, as well as for a victory by NOTA/RON)."
771,Does any other governmental body have constituencies similar to Seanad Éireann?,NEGATIVE,"Seanad Éireann (the Irish Senate) has rather unusual (unique?) constituencies. Three senators are elected by graduates of the University of Dublin. Three senators are elected by graduates of the National Universities of Ireland. Forty-three senators are elected in various panel elections. 43 elected from five special panels of nominees (known as Vocational Panels) by an electorate consisting of TDs (member of Dáil Éireann), senators and local councillors. Nomination is restrictive for the panel seats with only Oireachtas members and designated 'nominating bodies' entitled to nominate. Each of the five panels consists, in theory, of individuals possessing special knowledge of, or experience in, one of five specific fields. In practice the nominees are party members, often, though not always, failed or aspiring Dáil candidates. Wikipedia The remaining eleven senators are directly appointed by the Taoiseach. The vocational panels and the university constituencies are certainly odd. Are they actually unique?"
772,Why did Marx believe that mass industrialisation was a prerequisite for the proletarian revolution?,NEGATIVE,"Apparently, Marx believed that mass industrialisation was a prerequisite for the proletarian revolution. Why did he believe this?"
773,"",NEGATIVE,"Mass industrialization, in his view, was dehumanizing. More industrialization, more injustice, which leads to conditions ripe for revolution."
775,"",NEGATIVE,"From his Communist Manifesto, Chapter 1, Marx believed that the industrial revolution brought about the existence of the proletariate, from the crises of Capitalism always needing new markets, greater exploitation of workers for more profits. Modern bourgeois society, [...] It is enough to mention the commercial crises [...] In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity — the epidemic of over-production. [...] And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons —the modern working class —the proletarians. [...] Marx didn't believe the previous classes, or class struggles were long lasting. Eventually, society would have to collapse to socialism with no more private property rights. Instead, the proletariat would do away with all national divisions for the ever increasing size and power of the union. Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product. The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Modern industry and its division of capital and labor, places ever increasing pressures on labor to reduce costs. The opening of new markets removes the isolation of laborers from one another. The proletariat, as the lowest class, sinking further and further into poverty has no choice but to revolution. Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its slavish existence. [...] The modern labourer, on the contrary, instead of rising with the process of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth. And here it becomes evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law. It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its existence is no longer compatible with society. The essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage-labour. Wage-labour rests exclusively on competition between the labourers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by the revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable."
776,"",NEGATIVE,"The answer to your question can be found in the first chapter of the Communist Manifesto, Bourgeois and Proletarians. The tone of the chapter is set by its oft quoted opening sentence: The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Marx had witnessed the effects of mass industrialization first hand, and believe that, at the time, societies were split to two main, and often hostile to each other, factions, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat: Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other -- bourgeoisie and proletariat. He believed that mass industrialization was the key factor for the rise of the bourgeoisie, and the widening of the gap with the proletariat: The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development. The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was monopolized by closed guilds, now no longer suffices for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed aside by the manufacturing middle class; division of labor between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labor in each single workshop. Meantime, the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacturers no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionized industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the giant, MODERN INDUSTRY; the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois. Modern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages. He argued that mass industrialization was in a way the bourgeoisie's own revolution, and if taken too far it would destroy the proletariat: A similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade past, the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production, against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule. It is enough to mention the commercial crises that, by their periodical return, put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial, each time more threateningly. In these crises, a great part not only of the existing products, but also of the previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity -- the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed. And why? Because there is too much civilization, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand, by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented. The conclusion of the chapter posits that mass industrialization will inevitably lead to a proletariat revolution: The essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage labor. Wage labor rests exclusively on competition between the laborers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the laborers, due to competition, by the revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable."
777,"",NEGATIVE,"No, US could not do that in the present legal, cultural and political climate, independently of whether it's a good or bad idea. In the present time, there are strong political forces (who are supported by the judicial decisions) who interpret the Establishment clause of the First Amendment as \"Freedom FROM religion\" as opposed to merely \"Freedom OF religion\" - the latter of which is the spirit in which the Indonesian law you used as an example was created. The most clear linguistic example of this is the phraseology of \"Separation of Church and State\", the phrase used to back up such thinking, but which does NOT appear in the Constitution (it originated in Jefferson's letter, and was first used by the US Supreme Court in 1800s and only started to be used regularly by SCOTUS since 1947). The original usage by both Madison and Jefferson was mostly concerning high level issues (legislatively elevating one religion over others, establishing a state Church). However, in today's USA, the view of ACLU and many others is that no branch of government may have anything to do with religion whatsoever (basically, following the \"hostile separation\" model established by French in 1905 or Spain in 1931."
778,"",NEGATIVE,"Just to clarify, the original comment was made by me in error and subsequently amended in the follow up comment to refer to Nativity scene and not the Christmas tree (the former being a religious symbol). As such, the answer to your question is \"it depends\". Different courts in USA decided differently: In some cases, it is permitted alongside other religious symbols: In 2006, a lawsuit by the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative Christian group in the United States, was brought against the state of Washington when it permitted a public display of a holiday tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene. Because of the lawsuit, the decision was made to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in the rotunda of the state Capitol, in Olympia, as long as other symbols of the season were included But sometimes, Nativity scene is prohibited even if other religious symbols are included (src): In federal court pleadings in the United States, for example, the New York City, school system defended its ban on nativity scenes by claiming the historicity of the birth of Jesus was not fact. The judge in the case upheld the ban, noting that the ban on nativity scenes is not discriminatory while permitting Jewish menorahs and Islamic star and crescent displays because the latter two have secular components while nativity scenes are supposed to be purely religious. In another instance, a suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, school banned a nativity scene while permitting a menorah display. The school's principal stated, \"Judaism is not just a religion, it's a culture\" On a personal level, I consider the last argument as pure hogwash of monumental proportions. Menorah (more technically, chanukkiyah, which is a special 9-branch Menorah displayed on Chanukkah and is usually involved in cases around Christmas) is mainly used to commemorate a divine miracle of the oil in one lamp lasting for 8 days, not exactly a secular idea."
779,"",NEGATIVE,"The relevant legal doctrine for this kind of setup would be 'the Lemon Test', named after the court case Lemon v. Kutzman. Specifically, as this page shows, the Lemon test puts all establishment cases into a three part test: Three ... tests may be gleaned from our cases. First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. In order to afford the instruction of the targeted group, all three tests would need to pass. Even as a Christian pastor, I would have difficulty seeing any of these tests passing muster, let alone all of them. The legislative purpose of such a set up would be to encourage people in their own religion. While this might conceivably be 'good' it is not secular. The state may have an interest in having its people have 'values' but it would be argued that these can be taught without regard to a religious system. Indeed, as this NPR story shows even teaching something like yoga will incite controversy, if parents believe it to be teaching Hinduism alongside 'values.' Especially in a society that tends to promote tolerance and understanding, I suspect that inculcating individual and separate religions would be argued against by such groups as Barry Lynn's Americans United or other such groups. At the very least, there would be a lot of controversy around such a proposal. Clearly, this scheme would advance religion in general, over against no religion whatsoever. Atheists tend to be very touchy when told their belief system is a religion, and even if the 20% of 'unaffliated' (according to the Pew Research Center) were given their own inculcation, there would be resistance to treating 'unaffiliated' or 'atheist' as a 'religion' on equal par with established ones. Setting up such a system would inherently entangle local school district in religion generally. Lest someone say 'education is a local issue,' it should be noted that every since Burlington v. Chicago, the Bill of Rights does apply to local instititions. In short, it would be very difficult not to run afoul of the entanglement clause with such a setup. While the Bible can, for instance, be studied as literature, it is very clear that that is about as far as one can go in a public school environment."

It sometimes includes the Philippines, Indonesia, and the other Oceanic countries, and it sometimes includes eastern Russia and the Indian subcontinent. The Near East is the eastern Mediterranean region once dominated by the Ottoman Empire. Note: the origin of the term is of course in Europe, thus the \"near/far\" distinction. Middle East - originally referred to everything between the other two Easts (Mesopotamia to Burma) - but it now usually denotes the Near East in addition to Afghanistan, Iran, and the Arabian peninsula. As a more authoritative example, according to the AP Style Guide (src), the countries of the Middle East are Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Egypt, Sudan, and “the eastern part of Turkey.” Noting that popular usage once distinguished between the “Near East” and the “Middle East,” AP recommends using Middle East unless a story source uses the term “Near East. ”"

Even worse, shortly before his death, Greely went mad, and was about to be committed. Had Greely been the winner of the general election, an interesting problem would have arisen - who should be President? As unpledged electors, the voters had put their faith in a representative sample of men (and yes, it was men!) who generally voted in line with what Greely would have wanted.

The Wikipedia article further states that for the past 10 years, it has grown mostly from displaced tribals and natives who are fighting against exploitation from major Indian corporations and local officials whom they believe to be corrupt. How much support do the Naxalites enjoy among the population? The Indian countryside does house a sizeable population in deep poverty, and Dalits are not rarely discriminated against.

786,"",NEGATIVE,"When I worked on the Hill (the U.S. Capitol) back in the '90s, I had the opportunity to visit with the staffs of several members of Congress, both on the House and Senate side. What they do: (Hint - Read the Mail and vette the issues) Typically, there were three types of political aides: Interns / Junior Legislative Assistants On the bottom of the totem pole were the guys (and gals) doing \"Constituent Services.\" This basically involved reading all the mail that came in, and doing one of two things. If the letter was regarding policy coming in front of the member, the opinion would be discerned, the results marked in a tally (to get for &amp; and against), and a response would be put together drawing from language that had already been approved by the member. The fun responses were always the off-the-wall \"the CIA is stealing my brain waves,\" variety. I did once have a friend who suggested a tin foil hat, and was thanked for the response. The other segment of mail was the \"help, the government is screwing me over\" category, in which a constituent was the victim of some bureaucratic snafu, and the Member would then write to the officicrat or minor potentate involved, asking them politely to reconsider their draconian approach to implementation. (Translation: The guy who votes for me is getting screwed. I control your funding. Want to re-think what you are up to?) The legitimate variation on this is a recommendation to one of the military academies. All would-be students need personal recommendations from their member of Congress. Since very few students actually know their member directly, interns get to write the glowing recommendation. It is typically a form letter, too. Note: Answering mail is the day-to-day work of the office - both the miniscule closets they call \"offices\" on the Hill, and in the luxurious district offices located back home. The prestige is definately on the hill, but it is an honor much like the Lawn Rooms at UVA. You pay for the \"honor\" by giving up any semblance of comfort. You also work insane hours when the Congress is in session. Note also, on the House side, you'll typically have 5 - 10 junior staff (all sitting in one desk the size of a normal cubicle!), and on the Senate, typically 20 - 30. Random fact - every room in the Capitol complex, from the Ford Annex to the Russell building have office numbers that are either HOB-XXX (house office building), or SOBs, for Senate office Buildings... Indeed, the latter is often highly appropriate. Legislative Assistants After you get a little bit of tenure under your belt and develop a certain amount of acumen, you move up in the world. The job of the Legislative Assistant is to become the expert on certain pieces of legislation. For all but the most trivial legislation (using a resolution of some kind honoring some guy you've never heard of), the LA is the person who reads the bill, gathers the research, and must present both sides to the member. (Note: For the 1000 page bills, usually staff from various officies will pool their work, or, even in some cases, the staff will be attached to the committee, rather than the member.) The LA's obvious influence here comes from his or her expertise. Having read the bill and done the research, the LA can use what he knows of the members native views to advise the Member, both in terms of how the Member should vote and what the opposition will do. The rookie mistake here is for the LA to either neglect both sides of the case, or ever let the Member catch on to the power the LA has. LA are disposable - every two years its a game of musical chairs anyway - and in any event, most worker protections don't apply. As such, if the LA is not acting in accordance with the Member, they will be canned. So, the smart ones learn to be neutral-seeming purveyors of knowledge upon which the Member feasts. Note also, the best lobbyists will lobby the Member, but they will also get to know the LAs well. It is not unheard of for the Member to have an idea, and ask the LA to draft a bill. The overworked LA, in turn, goes to the lobbyist and asks for \"model legislation.\" This gets looked over, tweaked, and presented to the Member, who submits the bill. Legislative Director Know that movie meme of the secretary who knows more than her boss? That's the LD. The LD supervises the LAs, and has the ultimate power - the power of the Member's calendar. An administrative assistant might actually hit the keys in Outlook, but the LD schedules the votes, the committee hearings, and the lobbyists that the members will see, the lunches the Member will attend, and scheduling the hours in which the Member will step outside of the buildings to dial for dollars. LDs are often building their own connections, either in order to: a. Go run the Committee Staff (e.g. \"I'm the shared resource on the Appropriations Committee\") b. Go run a small to large executive department (There are about 8000 Schedule C political appointees running departments of 50 - 50000 people - offices like the FEMA, the NCIX, National Labor Relations Board, the FCC, etc...) c. Consider running for the Members seat when the Member retires d. Go run a Think Tank like the Heritage Foundation or the Children's Legal Defense Fund Politicians often get to know the LDs as well as the Members themselves, because of the control the LD has over the schedule and hence the Member. The LDs can actually get things done. Because of these relationships being built, the LD is amassing a powerful personal asset that can be used when the LD burns out (typically in his mid to late 30s or early 40s.) This is the game - you pay your dues and you move on. And then, of course, there is: The Member This is the guy that actually got elected. He votes, makes appearances, and hires a very good LD to control his schedule. Of the 438 members of Congress, there are probably about 10 - 20 that actually matter, and all but 3 of them think they are in that 10 - 20. Most of his time is spent talking to people and saying \"My staff will get back to you. Now, let's step out of the office so you can tell me, how are you going to help my campaign?\" (Kidding aside, the Member's chief role is fundraising, leading this herd of kittens, and making the final call on votes. Trust me, that's work enough!) What political aides don't do The big rule about political aides is that they do not solicit votes. To be sure, every constituent contact is good PR, but the rules are very, very, very clear that the appearance of impropriety in asking for money or votes is a big NO-NO. Even the Member leaves the Capitol complex, heads down to a little shelf and uses the telephone outside the building, when asking for money or votes. That's why the Member has so many offices. You just can't do anything to get [re]elected from within the building - at least not overtly. If you want to volunteer for the campaign on your own time, outside the building, go knock yourself out. But you do not mail a letter, you do not make a call, you do not update the Member's campaign web page from within the walls of a Congressional building. That gets the member in trouble, and you fired. So, to sum up - Aides advise the member, answer the mail, and fix stuff for voters constituents 24x7x365. They sleep between 3am and 4am, and either burn out or just go slowly insane. And these are the 20 - 25 year old guys really running the country, at least when they are sober. Sleep well."
787,"",NEGATIVE,"In fact, there was a We The People petition asking the White House that very question: Are these petitions actually taken seriously? This petition generated the requisite 25,000 signatures in 30 days earning it an official response from the White House. In their own words: Each of the 97 petitions that have crossed the signature threshold so far have been carefully reviewed by experts here at the White House and in agencies across the federal government, and the majority have already been answered, with more coming every week. As for petitions that sparked substantive change on top of a review and response, however, the White House points to two petitions in particular. The first was a petition from animal rights activists seeking changes to the way breeders who sell puppies online are treated. This prompted a proposed new rule from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to crack down on this loophole. The White House also highlighted their response to a petition to digitize federal records which in addition to a response prompted a conference call between the petitioners and the federal archivist to investigate ways to improve the process per the petitions request. By the White House's own accounting, these two seem to be the biggest impact that these petitions have had (at least since October of 2011). In my investigation, I was not able to find anything more substantial since this response either."
788,"",NEGATIVE,"It doesn't appear that you will be able to claim a revenue neutral score for your proposal here. From the Tax Policy Center (the specific example quoted below relates to bonus depreciation, but the numbers are illustrative): Accelerating depreciation deductions does not increase the total amount a company can write off for a given investment. Instead, it allows businesses to deduct more of the cost now and less in the future. That reduces their current taxes at the cost of higher taxes later. The Administration estimates that its proposal will reduce revenues by approximately $200 billion in fiscal years 2011 and 2012, but by “only” $30 billion over ten years. The real crux of the calculation will be the CBO's projection for likely tax code changes over the course of the 10 year period that are relevant to your depreciation calculation. If the rate changes over the same time window that the asset has value remaining to be taxed, then it will improve or hurt your scoring and result in a score that is not revenue neutral."
789,"",NEGATIVE,"Wikipedia has a good breakdown of the different flavors of this argument in this article. The argument was born out of the libertarian movement whose championing of individual rights above all else favors the idea of getting the government out of any agreement that is entered into willingly amongst two free individuals. As such, there is much less support from this argument from the liberal side of the spectrum and gay rights groups included. However, that is not to say they are nonexistent. The same Wikipedia article points to recent articles from liberal leaning columnists Michael Kinsley and Alan Dershowitz in support of the argument on separation of church and state grounds. The article does not mention, and I was unable to find any explicitly \"gay rights\" activist groups that advocate for this position. The reason for this is largely the same reason that these groups feel civil unions are inferior to traditional marriage and why opponents of changing the definition of marriage oppose it so rigorously. The longstanding definition does have power from its longstanding tradition and culture and excluding same-sex couples from that institution, by abolishing it altogether (which would exclude same-sex and heterosexual couples equally from the institution), is little better than giving same-sex couples all the same rights as marriage in a vessel (civil unions) under a different name. As such, while there may be some tacit acknowledgement by individuals within these communities that no government recognition of marriage would be better than the current state, just as these gay rights groups do not support civil unions by and large but do not campaign against them either, so too would they prefer full marriage recognition to no marriage recognition for anyone."
791,Why did Musharraf quarrel with the Supreme Court?,NEUTRAL,"In reading about Pakistani politics I got the impression that the judiciary is closely associated with the military. However, I remember that Musharraf's fall from power began by his confronting the Supreme Court and trying to fire its head. How do these two points square?"
792,"",NEGATIVE,"I think this was part of a power play between then President Pervez Musharraf and chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry in 2007 over Musharraf's attempt to get an extraordinary prolonged mandate as his predecessors had also done, but as Chaudhry would not support. Here's an excerpt from the Aug 16th 2007 edition of The Economist: In 2002 General Musharraf amended this clause to grant himself a one-off dispensation [from the constitutional rule whereby the president may not hold a second office]. He would like to do so again. But constitutional change requires the support of two-thirds of parliament, which he does not have. Alternatively, General Musharraf could try to get re-elected as a civilian. He would then quit the army, either before his tenure expires on November 15th (though he says December 31st), or else he would hope to be re-elected by the next parliament. Either way, he will be at the judges' mercy. The constitution says the president must have held no other public office for two years. As to the root causes why the opinions were not fully aligned between the Pakistani judiciary and military in 2007, I think these were mainly attributed to Chaudhry as a personal actor, who had considerable popular support as well as support in the resulting lawyers' movement. I've also heard complaints from inside Pakistan that Western media tend to simplify and portray Chaudhry as a blameless hero: but as always, there must be interesting shades of gray, which I'd also be curious to learn about."
793,"What is the political/legal distinction between a \"state\" and a \"commonwealth\" in the United States?",NEGATIVE,"Some of the \"states\" in the United States are referred to as a Commonwealth rather than State (Virginia, Massachusetts, Kentucky and Pennsylvania specifically). The Wikipedia article for Commonwealth States indicates that there is no legal distinction between these states and other states and no differences in the rights enjoyed by citizens of these states. However, an article I was reading today speaks of local law enforcement officers who are refusing to enforce any new federal gun laws that may be passed in response to the recent mass shootings around the country. In that article a local official in Kentucky was quoted as saying: They need to go back and study that. We are a commonwealth. I can ask federal people to leave, they have to leave. I can ask state people to leave, they have to leave. Nullification of federal laws by states has been tried and challenged in the Supreme Court (see the Civil War) before and subsequently ruled to be unconstitutional via the Supremacy Clause. Therefore, is there any justification to that statement due to Kentucky's status as a Commonwealth? EDIT: Please do not focus on the constitutionality of any specific federal statute. The question is only asking for a legal difference between states and commonwealths as conflictingly referenced by Wikipedia and the article cited in the question. The origin of the law should be considered irrelevant."
794,"",NEGATIVE,"Actually, in a Commonwealth (e.g. Puerto Rico), some Federal laws (e.g. taxes) don't apply, so in one way, the good Sheriff was right &lt;/obi-wan kenobi&gt;. A commonwealth is a self-governing, autonomous political unit voluntarily associated with the United States, namely, Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. The problem is that none of the 4 US States (VA/KY/MA/PA) that officially call themselves \"Commonwealth\" are legally in a commonwealth status like Puerto Rico is, so overall he was wrong, since he's an officer in KY and not PR. Also, in the interest of clarity, that same official quoted in your question very explicitly stated that: If it goes through Congress, if it becomes law, if it goes that way, yeah, I'd enforce the law. He was making distinction between laws and \"Executive Orders\", and in no way was talking about \"Nullification of federal laws by states\" as you expressed it. Arguably, the new EOs that establish gun control establish new law, which goes beyond constitutional authority (though the only authoritative answer on that would require SCOTUS): the Supreme Court ruled in Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 US 579 (1952) that Executive Order 10340 from President Harry S. Truman placing all steel mills in the country under federal control was invalid because it attempted to make law, rather than clarify or act to further a law put forth by the Congress or the Constitution (src). A further point of interest - the concept of local law enforcement not cooperating with the Federales for political reasons is not new, nor is it some right-wing-nut invention. The idea was popularized (not sure about originated) by the concept of \"Sanctuary cities\", where standing immigration laws are not enforced."
795,"In the US, is it forbidden to label food as GMO-free?",NEGATIVE,"There is an ongoing debate about genetically modified organisms (GMO). For example, California voters rejected mandatory labeling of GMO-food. On a somewhat related note, in the US, it is apparently legal to feed artificial hormones to cows; this question addresses the issue. Despite earlier trials, labelling food as without using artificial hormones appears to be permitted. My question, is about labeling food that does not contain GMO. For example, this page claims: FDA won’t allow food to be labeled free of genetic modification Arguably, the arrival of GMO Salmon, also unlabeled, might spark renewed debate. Is it true that in the USA, it is not permitted to label food as free of genetic modification?"
796,"",NEGATIVE,"No, it is not true. You may label your food 'GMO-free' if you wish. Many 'organic' sites claim that the FDA is restricting them from labeling their food as 'GMO-free.' Notable for companies wanting to advertise products as non-genetically modified is the fact that the FDA says it will not allow labels like 'GM-free,' 'GMO-Free' or 'biotech-free.' This website points to these FDA documents. Docket No. 00N-1396, CFSAN 74. 'Premarket Notice Concerning Bioengineered Foods.' Docket No. 00D-1598, CFSAN 123. 'Draft Guidance for Industry: Voluntary Labeling Indicating Whether Foods Have or Have Not Been Developed Using Bioengineering; Availability.' I am going to focus on the latter, because the former has little to do with Bioengineered food labeling. The words in the title that should stick out to you is Voluntary Labeling. This draft guidance represents FDA's current thinking on voluntary labeling of foods indicating whether foods have or have not been developed using bioengineering. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. The agency is providing the following guidance to assist manufacturers who wish to voluntarily label their foods as being made with or without the use of bioengineered ingredients. and the text goes on to say: Terms that are frequently mentioned in discussions about labeling foods with respect to bioengineering include 'GMO free' and 'GM free.' 'GMO' is an acronym for 'genetically modified organism' and 'GM' means 'genetically modified.' [...] Terms like 'not genetically modified' and 'GMO free,' that include the word 'modified' are not technically accurate unless they are clearly in a context that refers to bioengineering technology. 'Genetic modification' means the alteration of the genotype of a plant using any technique, new or traditional. [...] Most, if not all, cultivated food crops have been genetically modified. FDA recognizes that there are analytical methods capable of detecting low levels of some bioengineered materials in some foods, but a threshold would require methods to test for a wide range of genetic changes at very low levels in a wide variety of foods. Such test methods are not available at this time. The agency suggests that the term 'free' either not be used in bioengineering label statements or that it be in a context that makes clear that a zero level of bioengineered material is not implied. So, the FDA is advising, not forcing food manufactures not to use the 'GMO-free' label, because it might be misleading to consumers. There currently is an organization that offers a similar label, Non-GMO product verified, but even they admit: Are products bearing the “Non-GMO Project Verified” seal GMO free? - Unfortunately, “GMO free” and similar claims are not legally or scientifically defensible due to limitations of testing methodology. In addition, the risk of contamination to seeds, crops, ingredients and products is too high to reliably claim that a product is “GMO free.” The Project’s claim offers a true statement acknowledging the reality of contamination risk, but assuring the shopper that the product in question is in compliance with the Project’s rigorous standard. The website url is included as part of the Seal to ensure that there is transparency for consumers who want to learn more about our verification. While the Non-GMO Project’s verification seal is not a “GMO free” claim, it is trustworthy, defensible, transparent, and North America’s only independent verification for products made according to best practices for GMO avoidance. The last part is lawyer speak, and is why they can get away with using the 'Non-GMO Project Verified' seal. (similar to how Quik can get away with, '100% real chocolate flavor')"
797,Did any large cities in Europe or North America ban outdoor advertising?,NEGATIVE,"In September 2006, Sao Paolo, Brazil banned outdoor advertising. Are there any examples of such measures in cities in Europe or North America? The only thing I'm personally aware of is that the former fringe political party Amsterdam Anders/De Groenen in Amsterdam, Netherlands proposed to rid the inner city of advertising, but as far as I'm aware, their proposal was never taken seriously by other political parties. I might be wrong, because this is entirely from memory and I can't find a source to confirm it."
798,"",NEGATIVE,"FDA doesn't simply \"not allow the food to be labeled free of genetic modification\". They are fulfilling their mandate by regulating which advertisements are OK (scientifically backed up) and which are \"woo\", to use Skeptics' favorite term. Quoting from your own link, the 3 examples were: The agency warned the dairy industry in 1994 that it could not use “Hormone Free” labeling on milk from cows that are not given engineered hormones, because all milk contains some hormones. So, they prohibited false advertising. Just what FDA's job is. It has sent a flurry of enforcement letters to food makers, including B&amp;G Foods, which was told it could not use the phrase “GMO-free” on its Polaner All Fruit strawberry spread label because GMO refers to genetically modified organisms and strawberries are produce, not organisms. OK, this one sounds like pure lawyering, but leaving aside that they are legally/regulatorily correct, as @user1873's answer noted: \"Most, if not all, cultivated food crops have been genetically modified\". Just because people using terms like \"frankenfood\" don't understand the concept of genetics, doesn't mean that 100% of crops that you eat were indeed genetically modified from their ancestral species by farmers for millenia of history. They just used much cruder tools/techniques. It told the maker of Spectrum Canola Oil that it could not use a label that included a red circle with a line through it and the words “GMO,” saying the symbol suggested that there was something wrong with genetically engineered food. This makes sense. You aren't allowed to slander competing products by implying they are somehow bad (which the red circle with a line is a universal symbol of), when you have zero scientific proof of said badness."
799,"",NEGATIVE,"The HIghway Beuatification Act of 1965, most often attributed to Lady Bird Johnson (LBJ's wife), curbed many forms of billboards across the United States - at least on federal roads, along their right of way. There are exceptions, but in general, a state loses its highway funding if billboards are allowed too close to an interstate. The tricky balance is that even commercial speech is still protected speech. It can be regulated, but the Supreme Court looks poorly on outright bans. Outside of the federal right-of-way, these things become local land use issues. Individual states and cities can use zoning laws and architectural review to prohibit certain structures (of which billboards are one), but then, as you say, property rights issues come to the fore. This leads many city zoning boards to be less than fully zealous in prohibiting commerical speech."
800,"",NEGATIVE,"The 14th Amendment does not account for the possibility of ending one's citizenship, rather it only makes reference to the start of one's citizenship. In the United States, it is not correct to say that because the Constitution does not speak to a particular topic it is disallowed for private civilians. In fact, the United States Constitution is one of enumerated powers and listed only those rights given by the people (and states) to the federal government. The limitations are on the federal government not on the people and this is explicitly stated in the Tenth Amendment: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Furthermore, you seem to be skipping the portion of the Citizenship Clause that says and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. This implies that people, even those born or naturalized within the United States, could enter a state of no longer being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. All Congress did with The Expatriation Act of 1868 is codify the specific rules associated with removing oneself from the jurisdiction of the United States. As such, it is consistent with the 14th Amendment and its Citizenship Clause."
801,"",NEGATIVE,"A registered lobbyist has to comply with disclosure requirements regarding his or her lobbying activity. As a paid professional, doing this more or less full-time, the decision has been made that people have a right to know what they are doing to influence Members. The paperwork involved, however, could also have a chilling effect on free speech. Inherently, the right to make one's views known and to advocate for them is pretty much the essence of freedom of assembly and speech. For the casual person who has a life outside of lobbying, this could be considered an onerous burden. As such, \"unregistered\" lobbying is thus permitted, up to a point. It is essentially an extension of de minimis, saying that for low levels of activity, the accounting cost is not worth the benefit."
802,"",NEGATIVE,"One point that is overlooked by these answers is the relative security of pen-and-paper voting. I recognize that because electronic voting is a departure from the traditional and accepted way of voting today it is inherently viewed more susceptible than electronic voting. However, if the standard is a system that is objectively in principle as secure as pen-and-paper voting, in person electronic voting with a paper backup is as secure for the reasons @MichaelMrozek lays out in his answer. The standard, however, should be to improve upon the security of pen-and-paper voting, not merely match the same shortcomings it already has."
803,"",NEGATIVE,"AE made some HUGE mistakes. It had incompetent PR. Instead of promoting the enhancement to democracy its nomination process provided, it allowed its detractors to spread false images of it as elitist. It should have taken on the debate with every critic who got any notice. Also, its Internet voting system was half-assed. The system didn't provide for a secret vote, but kept voter ID and vote together (see this article). AE was a great idea for a truly democratic presidential nomination process, but the idea was incompetently implemented and managed."
804,"",NEGATIVE,"In the United States, most all voting law is found at the state level rather than the federal level. To that end, states are allowed to change their voting procedures as they see fit with the exception of those states, counties and municipalities that are singled out in the Voting Rights Act as needing to be pre-cleared by the Department of Justice before they can make any changes to their voting policies. These are jurisdictions that in the view of the federal government have a history of discrimination in their voting policies and can no longer be trusted to continue to change policy without approval from the federal government. The freedom to change voting policies and systems at the state level, however, is why you see proportional distribution of electoral college votes in some states, for example. Similarly, this is why some states implement a caucus system for their primary elections, while other states prefer a straight majority vote primary system instead. Additionally, many municipalities allow voters to select multiple candidates in races for school board and city council for example, rather than selecting winners of individual races. So the ability to make those changes exist within the system at the state and local levels, but the willingness to implement changes to that system have by and large not yet arisen."
806,"",NEGATIVE,"This thread is about voting machines - DREs and opscans - located at polling places. A secure Internet voting system would have no polling places. Long lines and time wasted driving to, and finding parking around, polling places is a more salient problem than the security comparison. However, there have been no convictions in the US of any voter for commiting fraud on voting machines. There are only sensationalized stories used to attract folks to websites and for selling books and newspapers. All the voting fraud cases in US history involve paper. Its obvious which is more secure. See my comment at What challenges remain for online voting? for more on Internet voting."
807,Why is France involved in Mali?,NEGATIVE,"This month France has sent ground troops to and bombed northern Mali. This feels like the first time in a while that a country besides the US has stuck its neck out to fight violent Islamist groups that were operating in a foreign country. France has historical ties to Mali, but are there pragmatic reasons for the decision as well? The President of France, Hollande, is a socialist, which as an American I associate with being liberal and less prone to use military force abroad. So, what explains his decision?"
808,"",NEGATIVE,"The reason for French military action now is that the carefully crafted French-led plan of action (train African troops to fight the Islamists, with France as trainers) got thrown out the window since said Islamists declined to oblige waiting on the French/UN timetable and launched a major 2-column advance on the South that threatened to net them a complete win. Mali's government asked France to Do Something Right Now Before All Is Lost. That plan was basically United Nations Security Council Resolution 2085: adopted unanimously on 20 December 2012, authorized the deployment of the African-led International Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA). The reason France cares in the first place is because they are worried that Mali will become the new Algiers and thus threaten French interests, both in Africa and at home. From AP story, via FNC: France has some 6,000 citizens and economic and strategic interests throughout the Sahel desert region that includes Mali, interests to be protected. But the real fear is that a state run by radical Islamists could spread the doctrine throughout the Sahel and do what al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, one of the leading radical groups in Mali, has failed to do from its home base in neighboring Algeria — strike across the Mediterranean. At the moment, the threat is limited to Mali and potentially its neighbors — where terrorists can target western interests but lack the structure to do damage elsewhere, said Gohel said of the Asia-Pacific Foundation think tank. 'But they are growing in ascendancy. ... We're seeing the Talibanization process taking place inside Mali.' ... French authorities worry that the radicals could contaminate the diaspora of Malians in France and elsewhere, much as some Algerians in France took up the jihadist cause in the 1990s, sending weapons and money to Islamist insurgents in Algeria — and carrying out terrorist attacks in France."
809,Risks from proliferation of Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (drones),NEGATIVE,"When the U.S. gave missiles to the Afghan Mujahidins during the Soviet war in Afghanistan it arguably came back to haunt the United States. In relation to the current drone strikes it seems to me that on the technological side there are now all kinds of (innocent) related gizmos available even as consumer devices; it must be much harder to control the proliferation of drones than of nuclear weapons, say. The stakes have increased (again), and all kinds of \"surgical\" side effects from \"anticipatory\" self defense must linger. Consider e.g. this: It doesn’t take as much talent or experience or training to pilot a drone as it does to pilot a real plane. The skills are much like what you need to do well in a video game. And the C.I.A. has outsourced a lot of the drone piloting, which also raises interesting legal questions, because you not have only civilians running this program, but you may have people who are not even in the U.S. government piloting the drones. Are there anticipatory public analyses as to what (future) risks may be entailed in the currently accelerating drone program? Who writes them and what do they say? What books (other than those mentioned in Jane Mayer's article) may President Obama (or for that matter Prime Minister Netanyahu) have read on the topic before making their choices?

810,What is the difference between a constitutional law and a law,NEGATIVE,"In Britain, where I live, there isn't a distinction between constitutional law and ordinary statute law. Any law can repeal or amend any other law, and all laws follow the same procedure to be passed. The only exception is that a law to extend the term of the House of Commons can be completely defeated in the House of Lords, rather than merely being delayed one year, as any other law could be. Note that a law abolishing the House of Lords could be passed after the one-year delay. Different countries put different things into their constitutions, and have different degrees of entrenchment of their constitutions. What commonalities can we draw between these? What constitutional provisions are very unusual to include? What provisions are very unusual to omit?"
811,"",NEGATIVE,"The UK provides certain services to nominated candidates, paid for from the general fund of the country (\"taxpayer's money\" if you will; I'm trying to avoid overly emotive language). In particular (because it's the expensive one), anyone nominated in an election for Member of Parliament is entitled to have one piece of political literature delivered free of charge to every elector in their constituency. They have to produce the election communication themselves, and deliver the bundles to the Royal Mail, who then deliver it to the electors. The Royal Mail is paid for this delivery from the UK Government's General Fund. Candidates have always been obliged to pay a deposit, which is returned to them if they get more than 5% of the vote. In the 1980s, the deposit was £50, because it hadn't been changed since it was introduced in 1948. In one election, the owner of a take-away delivery restaurant (I believe it was a pizza place, but I've not been able to find a citation) and used the free delivery to send out an advertisement for his business. The deposit was then raised to £500 as disincentive for this exploitation of the political process for commercial purposes. Note that the vast majority of candidates from major political parties do get 5% of the vote and get their deposit refunded, while unserious candidates are £500 out of pocket, which fees approximately pay for their election communications."
812,"",NEUTRAL,"There is a rule of thumb called the cube root rule: the number of legislators in a legislature can be approximated by the cubic root of the population. Although it's essentially an observation about how the size of a population and its legislature are related, some researchers give it a normative twist (suggesting that a legislature should be the size predicted by the cube root rule). Although the original concept is older, the modern version was established by Rein Taagapera (1973), an Estonian political scientist whose work focused on modeling legislatures. This theory comes up frequently both in academic and general interest circles. Recently Jacobs and Otjes (2014) examined it from several different angles with interesting results. You can see the empirical evidence in a graph here."
814,"",NEGATIVE,"A constitution defines the basic framework for a government, its form and the form and relationships of its branches, the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. Furthermore most constitutions that were drafted after the French Revolution typically include a section recognizing basic human and civil rights, inspired by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Additionally constitutions often define the relationship between church and state, and in monarchies, the relationship between the monarch and state. The main difference between constitutional and ordinary law, be it statute law, case law or convention, is that constitutional law is considered fundamental and above ordinary law in all cases. Although constitutions can be revised and/or amended the process is extremely complex1 and time consuming (and often defined in the constitution itself). 1 To get a better idea of the level of complexity, you should check out the revision and amendment processes defined in the Constitution of Greece, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Constitution of Canada."
815,"Is setting a \"low bar\" on qualifications for elected office similar around the world?",NEGATIVE,"In the United States the official qualifications for becoming president, as laid out in the Constitution, are incredibly low. The only requirements are that: No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. Is it pretty standard in modern democracies to set the qualifications so low and allow the electorate to vet the appropriateness of the candidates qualifications? Or are there countries that require specific educational and professional achievements from their candidates before they seek high elective office?"
817,Does the US republican party have a demographics problem?,NEGATIVE,"I've read in various articles that, among voters for the U.S. Republican Party, middle-aged white men are (strongly) over-represented, whereas among voters for the U.S. Democratic Party, voters from other groups (African-Americans, Hispanics, women, young people) are over-represented. Then I have read the subsequent analysis that this poses a problem for the U.S. Republican Party, because the demographics where they are strong is shrinking. A quick Google search turns up many articles discussing the issue. Is this true? Do people vote according to their demographics (this is a candidate I can relate to, he talks about my kind of people), or is this subject to quite rapid changes so that the picture between subsequent elections might change radically?"
818,"",NEGATIVE,"I think Yannis alluded to this, but I would like to spell it out explicitly: First of all, the main difference between constitutional and \"normal\" law is practical: the former is meant to be very hard to change, and the procedure to change it has much higher threshold than for normal laws. This is why, for example, UK does not have what is considered a \"written\", or \"codified\", Constitution, despite having a set of laws which comprise its \"Constitution\". None of those laws are any different procedurally from any other law, and can be changed by the Parlament like any other law. In contrast, most of formal constitutions have special procedures for enacting/modifying them, such as constitutional conventions, and/or special majorities needed, and/or ratification by member states (as in USA). Second, and this one is a wee bit imprecise, a \"theoretical\" difference is that Constitutional law is meant to be a blueprint for how the state is organized and governed. In corporate-speak, it's a mission statement more than a specific rule. Details vary greatly, though. As far as patterns, commonalilties and unusualness, the Wiki article on Constitution covers that in a fairly good detail. Especially \"Key Features\" section, listing Entrenchment (e.g. rules for amending the Constitution itself) Distribution of sovereignty Separation of powers Lines of accountability State of Emergency rules As far as \"unusual\" provisions, we have way too many to list. Some random examples: Utah Constitution states that A judge out of state for more than 90 days running automatically loses his bench. US Constitution had 18th Amendment (Alcohol Prohibition) Tennessee Constitution prohibits anyone from office who participated in a duel. Too bad!"
819,"",NEGATIVE,"There are a couple issues at play here Democrats Are more in-favor of Social Justice and protecting or giving additional advantages to minorities, and if you are a minority, such policies benefit you, and it makes all the sense in the world to support it. Democrats are also more in-favor or providing for the poor(which also is disproportionally a minority group), and if you are poor, democrat policies benefit you. Democrats are also less aggressive toward immigration, and apparently being aggressive toward immigration is frowned upon by immigrants. Also, the term Demographics can mean a lot of things. It can be based on age, or even physical size, education, occupation, the kinds of hobbies you have, or even your own voting habits. In essence any set of people distinguished based on a criteria is a demographic. It's only natural that one parties' policies benefit specific demographics over others."
820,"",NEGATIVE,"To answer this question, there are two questions that need to be answered: 1) Are demographics a consist/stable indicator of party affiliation? 2) Are the demographics of the electorate that are growing more likely to be aligned with the Democratic party? To answer the first question, it is not difficult to find plenty of polling that has shown over the course of entire generations demographics do tend to stick with a particular political party. The chart below from the Pew Research Center is just one such example that shows remarkable stability across most demographic groups despite the large and controversial changes the country was undergoing throughout the two elections represented below. From this graph from the United States Census Bureau, we can take the information from above about party affiliation and determine if the groups that are growing represent those that more often favor the Democratic party: So with an increase projection from 17% to 31% of the population, right off the bat we can see that the roughly 20% point lead for Democrats with Hispanics is going to be a potential problem for them over the long term. Similarly, the Republican electoral advantage with White voters is likely to be impacted by the decrease projected for that population from 78% of the country to 69%. Additionally, since the national popular vote does not elect presidents in the United States, it is worth looking at the trend specifically for large Electoral College states. The biggest two contributors of electoral college votes are California and Texas. The real concern for the Republican party is these are also the two states with the largest Hispanic population growth. The problem is only exacerbated in these states. California doesn't actually pose too much of a concern for the modern Republican party, however, as they have not been competitive there in many years in state wide elections. Texas, however, is a solidly Republican state and a shift of power in this state would be even more detrimental to their national chances than these trends in other states. The real potential for change in this equation is the party itself as it is much more nimble than the population. During the 19th century for example, it was the Republican party led by President Lincoln that were the socially liberal caucus and civil rights legislation was passed over the loud objections of the Democratic party. If the Republican party adopts a similar shift toward policies that are favored by the Hispanic population this balance could shift dramatically. That action/inaction will really underline how much of a problem demographics become for the party long term."
821,"",NEGATIVE,"I don't know about traditional, but in most countries whose system derives from the British Parliamentary system (e.g. UK, Canada, Australia) you can stand as an MP if you are eligible to vote - i.e. you must be a citizen and you must be 18 years old. In some places there are residency requirements too, but they are typically only a few years. If you are elected as an MP there are no further barriers to being Prime Minister (other than getting your fellow MPs to vote for you)."

For instance, the current (January 2013) Prime Minister of Australia is Julia Gillard, who was born in Wales, not in Australia. Andrew Bonar Law was born in New Brunswick (now in Canada) and was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1922-23. The age restriction is also unusual; most countries grant the right of candidature at the same time as the right to vote. The length of residence is unusual too; most countries will allow anyone who is a citizen and a permanent resident to stand, even if they only moved back last week."
826,"In the US, why is there such a long time between the elections and inauguration?",NEGATIVE,"In the United States, the elections were on 6 November 2012, but inauguration only on 20 January 2013, more than two months later. In France, the presidential elections were on 22 April, and the inauguration about ten days later, in Russia circa 30 days. Why is this period so long in the U.S.?"
827,"",NEGATIVE,"Technically, the reason for January 20th is that the date is explicitly specified in Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The exact reason for January 20th is never stated, but given American Constitutional system is fairly clear: Congress should be in session BEFORE that, since in the event of a tie, Congress gets to choose the President. One of the main points of 20th Amendment was to prevent a lame-duck congress from choosing, instead of the newly elected one, such as repeat of the 1876 election. Quoting from Senate Judiciary Committee: This notion struck the Senate judiciary committee investigating that possibility as just wrong. \"It is quite apparent that such a power ought not to exist, and that the people having expressed themselves at the ballot box should through the Representatives then selected, be able to select the President for the ensuing term…\" Therefore, you really only have 17 days before Inauguration and start of Congressional Session - not THAT long of a time. A separate question is why the lame-duck Congressional session is so long (~2 months), but that was back in the day when Congress didn't meet as much."
828,"",NEGATIVE,"The original inauguration date was March 4th (prior to 1937 and the 20th Amendment). This was a necessity before the invention of the telephone, telegraph and automobile when it took quite a bit of time to get the word out about the election results (especially to the far flung states) and even longer to get the winners of those elections back to Washington D.C. Once modern technology made it possible to solve these logistical problems, the 20th Amendment moved the date much closer to election day, January 20th. The reason it is not even closer to election day is the same reason it was originally in March, logistics. It takes quite a long time for President Elects to hire their staff (this is the biggest management job there is after all), get their Secret Service detail setup, begin to get necessary security briefings, learn the nuclear launch codes and procedures, etc. For this reason, BOTH candidates begin a \"transition\" process long before the election is even over. This article does a nice job of highlighting the oddity that the Mitt Romney \"transition\" website is still available on the web. Indeed, the \"Readiness Project\" as the Romney team called it cost the federal government $8.9 million in order to enable him to actually take office by January 20th, in case he actually won. For this reason, January 20th is a lot closer to election day than it might appear."
829,"",NEGATIVE,"One argument in favour of not making this period any shorter is the sheer number of posts that is appointed by an incoming president. A search around the web indicates that this number may be of the order of 3000-4000 (#1, #2), or 6000 (#1, #2). Of those, about 1000 (#1, #2) require confirmation by the Senate. At the other end of the spectrum, in the UK, most of the civil service is made up of permanent, politically neutral, employees, who remain in their posts even when there is change in the governing party. As a result, the number of political appointees, who essentially form the entirety of the Government, is currently just 121 - and in fact, the number of paid ministerial posts is currently limited by law to only 109. In addition, when there is a change of governing party, the appointment of a new cabinet may be smoothed by the fact that, when in opposition, that party would have had a Shadow Cabinet, with one member \"shadowing\" his or her counterpoint in the government. Hence it's not unusual for that person to be given the job they were formally shadowing. As a result of all this, the lame duck period can be very short indeed. In the 1997 general election, the polls closed at 10pm; John Major resigned around midday the following day, and Tony Blair was appointed Prime Minister less than an hour later."
830,Does the treasury get to decide which parts of the budget to not fund if the debt ceiling is reached?,NEGATIVE,"I am bit confused as to what the debt ceiling actually means. From my understanding congress passes a budget that instructs the treasury to spend money on specific programs. When the debt ceiling is reached, the treasury is unable to fulfill what congress has legislated in the budget. Which piece of legislation wins? Can the treasury choose to just pay of the interest on the debt using tax revenues, roll over the debt and then choose to fund only certain parts of the budget with the remaining tax revenues?"

Chapter 4: prohibited the taking of distrained goods or belongings out of the debtor’s home county, particularly where the removal was carried out by a landlord against his tenant Chapter 15: made it unlawful for anyone to distrain on the public highway Chapter 23: made it illegal for “fermors” deliberately to “make waste, sale, or exile” (without written permission) of any house, woods, men or any other thing belonging to tenements demised to them. They were considered for repeal by a Law Commission report in 2012, but were found to still be relevant. (Quotes are from the above report; see also here, here and here.) UPDATE, Jan 2016: A subsequent Law Commission report found that chapter 15, and part of chapter 4, have now been superseded and can be repealed (though at the time of writing, this has not yet happened). Chapters 1 and 23 \"appear to have continuing value\"."
833,What is Hong Kong's form of government?,NEGATIVE,"The Chief Executive is the head of the government in Hong Kong, but he/she is not publicly voted for, but rather is chosen by an election committee. In some ways, this is like a democracy, but in others, it is not. As a result, what form of government is Hong Kong most like?"
835,"",NEGATIVE,"Looks like Treasury is NOT currently legally constrained in what it can do. This article has pretty good analysis, but from a legal standpoint it amounts to \"no limits\". Possible options that they discuss are: Prioritize some payments. Especially servicing of existing and rolling over of maturing debt. This seems like fiscally prudent option, since it avoids credit default. As a matter of fact, Sen Toomey tried to introduce the legislation to force Treasury to service the debt first, so far unsuccessfully since Democrats find it a big political loss if Republicans manage to decouple the risk of default from the need to raise debt ceiling). However, even political games aside, this may be hard to do practically, since in its infinite wisdom our government didn't design the payment systems to be ABLE to prioritize at will, as per the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC). However, RealClearPolicy blog quotes Wall Street Journal thusly: Despite the Treasury’s insistence that prioritization is unworkable for logistical reasons, the same Journal story reports that interest payments on the debt are made through a separate system altogether: “It is technically possible to prioritize interest payments because they are delivered over a different payment system, known as Fedwire, than the millions of other day-to-day payments the government makes to vendors, Social Security recipients and others.” Given that the point of prioritization schemes like Toomey’s is to ensure that U.S. Treasuries wouldn’t be called into question, this is an important fact. Pay with delays as the funds become available, on first come first serve basis. BPC has very detailed analysis on what the delays would look like. Fitch seems to have doubts about whether the debt could be serviced, but I'm not sure I greatly trust Fitch to be correct :) With no legal authorisation for net debt issuance, the Treasury would be forced to immediately eliminate the deficit - a fiscal contraction twice as great as the recently avoided 'fiscal cliff' - by delaying payments on commitments as they fall due. It is not assured that the Treasury would or legally could prioritise debt service over its myriad of other obligations, including social security payments, tax rebates and payments to contractors and employees. Arrears on such obligations would not constitute a default event from a sovereign rating perspective but very likely prompt a downgrade even as debt obligations continued to be met."
836,"",NEGATIVE,"TL;DR: Impossible to classify in a proper way. It is a combination of a somewhat-Presidential-Republic (Chief Executive independent of Legislature), but constrained by the will of PRC in some ways, so it's not a full-on Democracy. From http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html The method for selecting the Chief Executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures. So, from one angle, due to universal suffrage, it's a form of democracy. From another angle, practically, it's NOT in force at the moment: through interpretation of Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which ruled out the possibility of universal suffrage in 2007 and 2008 on 26 April 2004."

838,What would it take for the U.S. to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child?,NEGATIVE,"Together with Somalia and South Sudan, the U.S. has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I think the reasons for Somalia and South Sudan are quite clear — Somalia has not had a functioning government in decades, and South Sudan is simply too young a nation to have signed and ratified all those important treaties yet. The Wikipedia page on U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child cites a number of arguments used by political opposition to ratification in the U.S. However, the page also states that: [President] Barack Obama has described the failure to ratify the Convention as 'embarrassing' and has promised to review it. What would be required for the U.S. to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child? Is this up to the President or is it Congress that decides? And has it not been ratified because a majority opposes ratification, or because it simply hasn't been put on the agenda out of low priority?"
839,"",NEGATIVE,"In the United States, treaty ratification is done in Congress, specifically in the Senate. The Constitution gives the President unique powers in foreign policy (it is his primary Constitutional portfolio) and the President is responsible for meeting with and negotiating the terms of any treaty the United States wishes to enter into independently (without any Congressional oversight). However, when it comes to ratification of a negotiated treaty and implementing it as legally binding in the United States, that is left to the legislative branch, and specifically the Senate (the House of Representatives does not vote on treaties). When the vote comes up in the Senate, a 2/3rds majority (67 votes assuming full attendance) is needed for ratification. This 2/3rds ratification hurdle is on its surface the reason this treaty has yet to be ratified in the United States. If we look at history, we can see a prime example of the odd effects this segregation of duties sometimes has. The League of Nations was the brainchild of American President Woodrow Wilson and he included the terms of its founding into the Treaty of Versailles, ending World War I. However, the Republican Party in the Senate, led by Henry Cabot Lodge rejected the idea of the United States joining an international organization like the League of Nations on the grounds of sovereignty. As a result, the United States never ratified the treaty nor joined the League of Nations which was its President's idea to begin with."

The concerns here seem to stem from the activities of the Committee which regulates and oversees implementation. Some info can be found on this page from Concerned Women for America. More generally, there is pretty wide opposition in US politics to signing on to treaties or conventions of this sort, the best known example being the International Criminal Court. The United States generally opposes or at the least is reluctant to make itself subject to the authority of any other organization."
841,"",NEGATIVE,"It is important to note that what the debt ceiling actually is, is the bill for spending that has already taken place coming due for payment, not the initiation of new spending. So there is no conflict between which law Treasury should follow, because that decision was already made some time in the past based on the Full Faith and Credit of the United States. The money needed to implement all spending, not some of it, has already been spent (on credit) and the debt limit being reached is just a marker of when that money physically leaves the Treasury's account. The debt limit is the statutory limit of borrowing that the Treasury is allowed. In fact, the United States would have reached the limit sometime in December, however, the Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner has been making prioritized decisions for awhile now in order to extend the deadline as far as possible. That is, he has stopped funding discretionary things within the federal government that don't go to outside creditors so that there is more money on hand to pay those creditors as their bills come due. There are logistical problems with prioritizing payments further as Senator Toomey would like to mandate that @DVK did a good job of laying out in his answer. However, most observers think that the government would still default without a raise in the limit, because the payments owed in March (when the limit is expected to be reached) do not all come due at the end of the month. Most are due on the 15th, and the income tax revenues the Treasury takes in each day very wildly. While the United States takes in enough in a month to pay these minimum payments, it is unlikely that we would do so early enough in the month to make all payment obligations."
843,How does the Swiss system for Einbürgerung (naturalisation) work?,NEGATIVE,"Around ten years ago, I read in a Swiss newspaper article in NZZ am Sontag about a mayor who was not accepted as a citizen of his own village. I have found the article on the internet: «Dickschädel aus dem Laufental. Heinz Aebi, Gemeindepräsident, wird doch noch eingebürgert. Von David Hesse» This article uses the word Einbürgerung in a context I don't understand. Normally, Einbürgerung means something like to obtain the citizenship of the country: I think in English it's naturalisation. In the aforementioned article, however, the canton government was calling upon all citizens born in other cantons to apply for Einbürgerung in their municipality. So this is not about foreigners applying for naturalisation as Swiss citizens, but Swiss people from one municipality applying for naturalisation in another municipality. German is not my native language, so I am not sure if the summary below is correct. I think that the article is about a village, Nenzlingen, where permission for Einbürgerung (naturalisation) is decided by the Bürgerratsversammlung — in my understanding, a kind of council of elders, of all citizens calling the village their home. If I understand correctly, this council denied the Einbürgerung (naturalisation) of their own mayor, because he had not been loyal with the distribution of hunting rights. Either I'm not understanding this correctly, or it is bizarre. The mayor of the village who does not get permission to become a citizen of the village. What does this mean? How does the Swiss system for Einbürgerung really work?"
844,How does the Cuban system for municipal elections work?,NEGATIVE,"In Cuba, the Communist Party of Cuba is the official state party. According to the Wikipedia article on the Cuban electoral system, Candidates for municipal assemblies are nominated on an individual basis at local levels by the local population at nomination assemblies. (...) The election of municipal assembly delegates involves nomination by voters in nomination assemblies, compilation of posting of candidate biographies, voting by secret ballot, and recall. How does this work in theory, and how does this work in practice? Are candidates screened by the government, the Party, or otherwise? Or can anybody nominate anyone? According to the Wikipedia article, the Cuban government contends that the Cuban political system is democratic. To what extent can this be confirmed or denied as far as local elections are concerned?"
845,What are the practical implications of the claims for Antarctica?,NEGATIVE,"Several countries maintain territorial claims in Antarctica: What are the practical implications of those claims? The Wikipedia article mentions scientific research stations administered by a particular country often being in \"their zone\". However, several countries maintain research stations without making any claims. Hence my question: What are the practical implications of the various claims made to parts of Antarctica?"
846,"",NEGATIVE,"In all practical likelihood, these claims have had no affect since the 1961 Antarctica Treaty which was signed by each of the nations claiming rights to land in Antarctica. The motivation is simple, if oil or other valuable natural resource were to be discovered in Antarctica in an area claimed by one of these countries, they would claim sole right to the profits from these resources. However, the legitimacy of these claims would need to be adjudicated at such time that a dispute arose, and the Treaty is widely viewed in the international community as superseding these claims. Having said that, it has not stopped countries from taking rather extraordinary steps to bolstering their claims. When Captain Jorge Emilio Palma, of the Argentine research station Esperanza, wife became pregnant she was airlifted by the Argentine government to the station in Antarctica so that the first person born in Antarctica, Emilio Palma would be Argentine. This was a naked attempt at bolstering their sovereignty claim to Antarctica."
847,What are the political reasons for a strong Euroscepticism in Britain?,NEGATIVE,"Britain is fairly heavily \"Eurosceptic\": Within Europe overall, a positive to neutral opinion of the EU dominated, with about 46% of citizens having a positive opinion and only 16% having a negative opinion; about 36% had a neutral opinion. In Britain, only 22% had a positive opinion, 33% had a negative opinion, and 38% had a neutral opinion. On the other hand the justifications on the Wikipedia page I linked are very generic: presumed corruption and democratic deficit. Both these topics may or may not be strong reasons in general terms - fair enough. However Britain is much more sceptical of the EU than most other countries. Certainly those reasons are not Britain-specific and do not explain the differences. What are the underlying causes of such strong isolationism?"
848,What makes California a Democratic state?,NEGATIVE,"So, back in the 60s &amp; 70s, California gave us Richard Nixon. In the 80s, President Reagan hailed from the state. At least as late as 1984, California was considered a safe Republican state. During my politically active life, however (I started caring late 80s and was eligible to vote in the early 90s), California has always been seen as one of the most liberal states in the union. One would assume that as a microcosm of America, something as essential should at least be competitive - but I can't remember it ever being so. So, what changed in the 80s to turn California Democrat, and what keeps it so solidly so, especially at the Presidential level? Note: There has been a valid objection raised to the idea that California is a solidly Democratic state. Namely, what about Arnold Schwarzenegger? Arnold Schwarzenegger seems to be an exception rather than the rule. He won election after the recall of an unpopular governor, in a very, very crazy election He always had to deal with a hostile, Democratically controlled legislature Even now, that legislature has a super-majority of Democrats. Even beyond Arnold Schwarzenegger, however: The state hasn't voted for a Republican in a statewide election since 1988. The Republican party hasn't even been competitive since then. The Senate Delegation is entirely Democrat, and very liberal at that. Nancy Pelosi hails from CA. and the list goes on."
849,"",NEGATIVE,"Great Britain has always played a role that is \"in Europe but not of it.\" Historically, ever since the Henry's gave up their Norman lands, Britain's foreign policy always saw Europe as a market - not a source of its identity. The Channel is a moat that has never been breached since 1066. Territorially, England doesn't have the same border concerns that France, Germany, or Italy do. During the Age of Empire, its holdings outside of Europe were far bigger than that within. This concentrated its ambitions well beyond the scope of Europe - in contrast to France, which saw its possessions in North Africa as extensions of France, and Germany, which had relatively little going on in the way of colonies. (Yes, I know somebody is going to bring up Namibia, but come on - its not like we're talking all of India and the Nile valley!) Afterwards, Britain's \"Special Relationship\" with the United States turned it into a fence sitter - somewhere between \"Europe\" (meaning France and Germany) and America. This special role, along with its role as the world's financial center, has always been pretty sufficient for mercentile England. Even from an intelligence perspective, England is the only European member of the \"Five Eyes\" - the English speaking countries with which the United States shares the highest level of intelligence. The UK cares thus about Europe, but not in the same way Germany, Poland, France, or Italy does. The UK is clearly not an extension of America, but it is the closest thing in Europe to it. Europe is a place to make wealth for England - but a potentially loss of soverignity for everyone else. As such, the UK thinks it really can just look in."
851,"",NEGATIVE,"Many people point to the overwhelming Republican support for (from the Republican Governor Pete Wilson on down), and passage of, Proposition 187 in 1994 as the catalyst that doomed the Republican party for a generation or more in statewide elections in California. The Proposition was an illegal immigration based ballot initiative that was similar in many ways to the recent controversial Senate Bill 1070 that passed in Arizona. It was intended to put in place a screening system to ensure that state services (education, healthcare, etc.) were not being used by those in the state illegally. The measure was rejected by over 60% of Democrats in the state while Republicans and Independents supported it to a tune of 78% and 62% respectively. This dichotomy tied the Republican fates to the popularity of the bill after it was enacted. As protests mounted, and subsequent campaigns were run as a referendum on Proposition 187 (the sitting governor was replaced by Gray Davis, a Democrat, who ran a campaign explicitly against Proposition 187), the Republican brand in the state suffered as well. Coupled with significant demographic shifts that sees 38% of the state's population now identifying as Hispanic, the party simply could not overcome the rising tide of the Democrats. Indeed, since the passage of Proposition 187 Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only Republican to win a statewide election."
853,"",NEGATIVE,"I'm not quite sure what you mean by \"practical\": If you mean what is the underlying reason for countries to make those claims, that's easy. Antarctica has plenty of natural resources, from ice, to stuff beneath the ice. Staking a claim in those resources is a Big Deal since consumable natural resources are one of the most valuable possessions you can possibly have, as far as the future. Related, but even more in the future, territory is even more valuable as a resource. Just because it's not currently usable with the current level of technology, won't always be the case. If you mean \"what effect will making those claims will have on the reality of the future rights to hold that territory\", then the answer is \"Pretty much none in practice\". Since there are no native populations there, in the long term the land rights will be allocated to whoever can exert enough force/influence to grab them, the way ALL land disputes have always been resolved. Said influence MAY be \"internationally legitimate\" (see @Michael's answer as far as assorted formal legalities), e.g. somehow approved by UN/international community. But it doesn't have to be if someone at the time will be powerful enough to make a grab - witness China holding Tibet, or Russia holding 4 Japanese islands (or, for that matter, Siberia which it conquered a couple hundred years ago, for the resources), or Falkland Islands/Malvinas being held by UK."
855,"",NEGATIVE,"It may yet be too early to address the \"moon base\" scenario directly (unless of course you are Newt Gingrich), however, the concept underlying this discussion is not unlike the one the first European settlers in America (among other colonies) struggled with. There appears to be two libertarian schools of thought on this subject. The purist camp makes the claim that absolute property ownership does indeed deprive non-owners of their rights to that land, a fundamental resource of life that all have equal rights to. Subsequent transfers of owned land to other parties is permissible and just, even in this purist view of libertarianism, so long as the transactions are voluntary, non-coercive and non-aggressive. The trouble arises in the original transfer of ownership from \"no one\" to someone. The purist argues that since all people have rights to all land originally, that unclaimed land is not owned by no one, but by everyone. At time 1, nobody owns anything, and everyone can access any piece of the world. At time 2, someone has “homesteaded” a piece of the world. This homesteading is done entirely unilaterally. Everyone else in the world is not consulted; their consent is not provided. [1] This means that the original transfer of ownership was not voluntary and therefore unjust. Future transfers then inherit the original injustice. As such, it is only right/moral/ethical to claim the unclaimed land once consent has been gathered from everyone on the planet. The second school of thought that was supported by the John Locke school of classic liberalism \"recognized that absolute ownership of natural resources could deprive liberty, but classified the great amounts of land populated by indigenous peoples as \"unsettled\", avoiding the issue in theory, if not in practice. [2]\" Essentially, they accept the position that unclaimed lands are truly unowned and can be claimed by anyone. The crux of the difference is that this school of thought contends that the natural resources, while they do exist and everyone has an equal right to them originally, it is only through the labor of man (the owner) that can realize any value from those natural resources. For example, coal has no heating value to you merely by existing. Sitting next to a pile of coal will not keep you warm through the winter without someone acting on the coal to enable it to produce heat; this actor become the owner of the coal through their efforts in producing something of value from the coal. Finally, since no one was doing anything with the resource before the initial owner, no one owned it, no consent was required to claim ownership as in the first school of thought, therefore the initial claim of ownership and all subsequent ones are legitimate. As to your question about the justification for paying someone an ownership fee to claim the land initially, this would only make sense in the purists vision and the someone would potentially be everyone depending on the terms of the transaction you as the potential owner would have negotiated with all other rightful claimants. The latter view would not expect payment for the initial claim as there would be no one to pay."
856,"",NEGATIVE,"Wikipedia has a short list of articles about LGBT groups and individuals opposed to same-sex marriage. However, I don't think the right-libertarian idea that the government should not be involved in marriage is common among LGBT activists (let's face it, the LGBT movement and its predecessors have been dominated by left-wingers for a long time). More usual arguments are: Marriage has too much misogynistic baggage (historically, in Western societies, wives were often expected to be subservient to their husbands), and should be done away with or replaced by an institution with a name like \"civil union\", \"civil partnership\", etc., to imply an equal relationship between two people - this position is sometimes held by lesbian feminists LGBT people should not seek to assimilate into mainstream society, but should maintain an independent culture (I'm not sure what a good source for this is, but Google \"queer assimilation\" for ideas like this) Marriage encourages the idea that long-term monogamous relationships are superior to other kinds of relationships, and should be opposed for that reason There do exist some LGBT people who are religious conservatives, or even avowedly homophobic (Brian Sewell being one example) and oppose it on those grounds There is also a practical argument that campaigning for marriage rights is provoking an unpleasant backlash, and that other campaigns (such as tackling bullying, violence, and discrimination) should be prioritized for the moment Presumably queer anarchists are generally opposed to marriage My guesses as to why marriage privatization isn't popular among LGBT activists: Taking marriage away from straight people is, politically, far more difficult to achieve than giving it to LGBT people LGBT people tend to feel oppressed by society as a whole, not by their government in particular - the government is likely to be seen as a tool to improve the status of LGBT people rather than an enemy It would not directly provide practical benefits to LGBT people: some people campaign for marriage rights because it would be financially beneficial, or make it easier to arrange hospital visits and funerals and so on."
857,"Has the British Monarch ever exercised their right to revoke land \"ownership\" rights for personal use?",NEGATIVE,"As I understand the British monarchy, all land in the United Kingdom is owned by the monarch. Owners of houses and businesses and the like within the United Kingdom are merely granted the use of the land by the reigning monarch, and are subject to return the land to the monarch if called to do so. I imagine that this is a right that has been exercised at various points in the past, but likely not very recently. Or, is my assumption wrong and this is a practice that still occurs if the government is looking to condemn property, rezone, etc.? In the United States, this type of activity does occur, but the government is obligated to provide fair compensation to the owners of the property. At least in theory, this would not be true in the United Kingdom. Does this type of activity occur, and if so, when was the last time it was executed?"

861,"",NEGATIVE,"Your premise is incorrect. Land in general in the UK is owned by the owners, not by the monarch. The monarchy has no right to confiscate land any more than elsewhere in the democratic world. While it is true that the 'allodial title' of all land belongs to the crown, this is a historical artifact indicating that the owner of the land still owes certain duties to the Crown, such as the requirement to pay taxes. The same system of allodial ownership operates in most common law countries, including most states of the US, where the ultimate ownership of the land is by the state. The monarchy (i.e. the monarch personally) owns a certain amount of land which she leases out to others on a long term basis, but it is not a significant fraction of the country; 'The Crown' (which is UK terminology for 'the state') owns a lot more, which is mostly used for government purposes. 'Crown land', originally owned personally by the monarch, is now owned by the government in return for 'civil list' payments.. It is also true that the government has rights to appropriate land under certain conditions, such as war or other emergency, or to make compulsory purchases for the public good, such as to build new infrastructure, and as you say the government is obliged to pay a fair price. Historically the Crown has confiscated land - most famously Henry VIII confiscating land owned by the Church - but this was not because of any claim that the king owned that land - it was simply confiscated. We are talking a long time ago here. I don't know details of when something like that last took place."
862,Why is redistricting not an automated process?,NEGATIVE,"What is the reason that redistricting is not automatic? Is it just a legacy of a time when it was impossible? The definition of gerrymandering is: In the process of setting electoral districts, gerrymandering is a practice that attempts to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by manipulating geographic boundaries to create partisan advantaged districts. It occurred to me (mostly as I am a CS major) that this is a process that can be done automatically, via clustering algorithms with the goal being to minimize the distance between points in the cluster, and have the clusters be the same size. This is not a \"hard\" problem to solve (technically speaking) and would remove all of the bias that gerrymandering puts into the political process. So, is there a reason this is not done?"

864,"",NEGATIVE,"Historically, there are two competing principles at work in figuring out districts: You want about the same population in each district This principle was enshrined in US Court law in Baker v. Carr an Wesberry v. Sanders. Malapportionment is inherently unfair. You want communities of interest not to be divided. That said, there is something to be said for ensuring that there is a diversity of opinion on matters, too. It is easy enough to be \"equal\" with numbers in such a way that certain voices completely disappear from the discussion. This is equally bad, and also to be avoided. In the USA, for example, Vieth v. Jubelirer basically said that a state can have unequal districts, if the state has a good reason - like if it ensures diversity or allows more voices to be heard. The first principle of gerrymandering, for example, can be algorithmically derived. It is possible, if the population were say, 1000 people, and there were 10 districts, to put exactly 100 people in each district. Grant you, with freedom of movement, that would hold for about 26 minutes, but hey - there is nothing says you couldn't have districts that exactly apportioned, say, the population on the date of Decennial census. An At-large seat actually does this in some ways - by lumping everybody into the same district, you most accurately represent the will of all the people in the district. But, what you miss is a community of interest. Imagine, for example, a three-district region consisting of 100 people, 45 of whom are ardent Yellows, 45 of whom are radical Browns, and 10 of whom are Chartruese. (Only the females can actually recognize those people, but I understand it is a color!). Chartrueses realize they will never be in the majority - and so they tend to vote for the proposals that benefit everybody. Assuming they are geographically evenly divided, it is trivial to create 3 scenarios: Gerrymander it such that B is the majority in 2 and Y in 1 District 1 - 20 Y, 15 B, 3 C, District 2 - 20 Y, 15 B, 3 C, District 3 - 5 Y, 15 B, 4 C Here, we see that Yellow will almost always will Districts 1 &amp; 2, and B gets 3. In no case do the C voices get heard, and most laws will favor the Ys, since they have more districts than Bs. We pretty much all agree this is unfair - to \"crack\" the Bs is bad. Alternatively, you could stick all 45 Bs into one district and \"pack\" them there- same basic effect. This is truly gerrymandering for political advantage, and is the unfair case. Put the population is 3 equal districts Each district could have 15 Y, 15 B, and 3 (or 4) C. On the surface, this looks fair, right? Except, here's the problem. In every district, the Cs hold all the cards. Any 2 Cs can swing the district for that entire election. As such, 6% of the population determines the outcome. If 6 Cs collude, they can silence every voice but there own. There are dictatorships that aren't this bad! Make 1 majority district for B &amp; Y, and 1 competitive district District 1 - 20 Y, 10 B, 3 C, District 2 - 10 Y, 20 B, 3 C, District 3 - 15 Y, 15 B, 4 C Here, you have communities of interests. District 1 will almost always be yellow, District 2 always Brown. This way, the Y &amp; B's voices will remain, but there is still the swing District C. This is arguably the most fair, because all voices are heard, and even the \"disenfranchised\" packed voters (the Bs in 1, the Ys in 2) have their voices being heard in other districts. Now, obviously, the world is more complex, but communities still fall into these patterns. Rural voters, for example, share similar values in many ways. And, their voices should, in a fair society, be heard in, possibly even in greater proportion then their numbers suggest. After all, politicians have to expend more energy to visit a rural area than an urban one. If voices were exactly equal, rural voters would be heard less. Communities of Interest can be geographical (think Virginia's Eastern Shore, Tasmania, Bavaria vs. Lower Saxony in Germany), ideological (think any party), or based on other factors. Balancing these factors is why humans get involved in the first place."
865,"What is a \"councilmanic tax\"?",NEGATIVE,"In my hometown there is an election next month for several propositions put forth. The second proposition would require any \"new councilmanic tax\" to be approved by the city council with a majority+1 vote. The voter's guide for the election defines a councilmanic tax (in this case) to be: A tax for which the City Council has the authority to levy but has not or is granted to the city council after March 1, 2013. A councilmanic tax does not include fees, rates and charges, or special assessments such a building permit fees, utility rates or LID assessments. So, I take it that a councilmanic tax is one which the council had a legal right to levy but just had not up until now. Is this generally what the term \"councilmanic tax\" refers to? I had never heard this term until I read the election ballot and I am curious about its implications and history. My hometown is in the USA, Washington State."

867,What can be done to limit the power of trade unions without hurting the right of assembly?,NEUTRAL,"Some claim that trade unions are essential for ensuring workers rights. At the same time, some powerful trade unions are being blamed for using their power to extort extremely high salaries and benefits, without any justification. What effective measures are being taken around the world to prevent big trade unions from taking advantage of their power, without hurting the right of assembly or the overall status of trade unions in general?"
868,"",NEGATIVE,"In much of the United States, there is a concept known as a \"Right to Work\" law. It simply says that unions may not require union membership as a precondition of working at a facility. It doesn't disallow the union, but it doesn't force it either. Unions argue that this \"free rider\" problem is a huge blow to Union power. This was so much the case that when Michigan just recently passed such a law, near riots broke out. In any event, union membership has declined from its highs in the 1950s to a mere 11% nowadays - its lowest point since the 1930s. Regardless of whether you like them or not, there is at least a plausible case to be made that these laws serve as a (either healthy or horrible, depending on your perspective) check on union power. In \"Union 1.0,\" once a workplace voted to organize, it effectively becomes a monopoly, requiring anyone who wishes to work at that facility subsidize the union. My wife, for example, as a teacher, can in many states, be required to financially support the NEA, even if they are promoting things that are exactly contrary to what she and I believe. Right to work does not compel such union subsidies, meaning that my wife would not, say, have to quit her job on principle. She could simply choose not to support the union. As such, the union has to not overreach, serving that useful check."
869,"",NEGATIVE,"There is very little incentive for a democratically elected government to undertake such an initiative. Increasing the money supply by lending inherently promotes investment and growth. The only alternative to increasing the money supply is to print more money, which is typically inflationary. Restricting the ability of the banks to increase the money supply kills off the profits of private banks in the short term (there would be no incentive for banks to do anything other than charge storage locker fees), thus alienating a constituency in the short term, and makes it such that only an unelected central bank has any power in the long run.

870,What are the arguments against an EU style transaction tax on equity and derivative markets?,NEGATIVE,"This week, the European Union voted to allow 11 member states to implement a transaction tax on all equity and derivative trades occurring on their stock exchanges. Under that plan, a 0.1% tax would be imposed on trades in stocks and bonds, while derivative transactions would be taxed at 0.01%. The United States has considered applying a similar tax on transactions in the United States in an effort to limit the number of high frequency of computer generated \"lightning\" trades whereby speculators buy and sell stocks in a matter of seconds based on the inputs of computer programs. These trades now far outweigh traditional investment driven trades in pure volume and have the potential to make the market more unstable. By instituting this tax, proponents hope that it will steer these speculative elements in the market toward a more conservative trading profile freeing up the markets for the traditional type of investments the average stock owner is familiar with and raise a substantial amount of revenue for the government in the process. My question is, what do the critics point to as reasons for avoiding this tax? Even within the EU, 16 member states did not join the proposal, so what were their concerns?"
871,How was the US able to create a Department of Education at the Federal level?,NEGATIVE,"Looking through Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution (that part of the document that enumerates the powers of the Congress), there is nothing that talks about Congress' role in education. Traditionally, this has been one of those powers left to the states. And yet, there is a federal Department of Education, overseeing the funding of schools and contributing money towards it. How was it that Congress was able to create such an agency without running afoul of the Supreme Court and implied powers reserved to the states?"
872,"",NEGATIVE,"The Department of Education was created in 1979 by then President Jimmy Carter. However, the function of overseeing education policy within the country has had some vestige at the federal level since 1867. For the bulk of its existence, until 1979, it existed below the Cabinet level as a office in the Department of the Interior. Proponents of its creation argued at the time that Congress had authority under the Taxing and Spending Clause and Commerce Clause of the Constitution to create an education agency at the federal level. The text of the Taxing and Spending Clause reads as follows: The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;[1] The key piece being the reference to the \"general Welfare\" being the justification necessitating the laying of taxes in the first place. More famously, this language also exists in the preamble to the Constitution, saying: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare In the view of the bill's supporters, the cause of general welfare for the population at large is advanced by educating the populace and preparing them for productive involvement in society upon graduation from school. This sentiment is mentioned specifically in the 1979 bill establishing the department: The Congress declares that the establishment of a Department of Education is in the public interest, will promote the general welfare of the United States, will help ensure that education issues receive proper treatment at the Federal level, and will enable the Federal Government to coordinate its education activities more effectively.[2] Therefore, the argument went: Congress has the right to promote the general welfare Congress can fund that effort through the laying of taxes Effective education of the population promotes individual welfare and is a boon to the economy at large Effective education of the population is best managed by a centralized department Therefore, Congress can create a Department of Education. A second argument was made justifying Congress' action under the Commerce Clause, which as currently interpreted by the Supreme Court is arguably Congress' broadest authority. The Commerce Clause says that Congress has the power to regulate anything that will have an impact on the nation's economy as a whole. That is: To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes;[3] Here the argument went that because an educated populace is more capable of producing quality goods for sale internationally, and taxing domestically, commerce is effected and can be advanced through federal action. Opponents, chiefly the members of the Republican Party in Congress in 1979, found this justification to be troubling. Congress they argued was limited to promoting the general welfare through only those powers enumerated in the Constitution's text itself and any remaining efforts fell to the states or individuals through the 10th Amendment which said: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Additional concerns about the fourth premise were also raised (i.e. \"is the federal government really more efficient at managing such efforts\"), but arguments about the effectiveness of the department are really ancillary to the justification for its existence in the first place."
873,"",NEGATIVE,"When you make it hard to make money by trading in locale X, you will usually find that people who were making money - and paying taxes and raising GDP - in locale X - will strongly consider moving to a different locale Y, which is now more competitive with the old location as far as offering them to be domiciled there. So, the only practical effect of such tax would be establishment of an exchange somewhere else where people can go do algorithmic trading, and they would no longer trade in your country. Instead of some increase in revenue from the tax, you get a LOSS of revenue from diminished economic activity (and thus profits to be taxed) in your country. You already see this in hedge fund flight from NYC to CT; or with US corporatons registering in Delaware, or with assorted financial firms going to Caymans. In case of trading and financial industry this is even worse effects wise, since they contribute very significantly to the economy of where they are (witness NYC finances - where do you think they would be if all the traders and bankers rolled up shop and moved to The City of London?) In addition, people who moan that somehow algorithmic trading causes problems for individual investors seem to have very little understanding of capital markets. They are claiming to be trying to solve a problem which DOES NOT EXIST. \"make the market more unstable\" is a nice soundbite which plays well on TV, but how does that affect individual investors? Long term, your stock price is a function of how much the markets anticipate your company to be able to grow its profits in the future. NOTHING ELSE. No matter how many algorithmic trades trading companies make against each other, if you as an individual investor intend to sell AAPL at 600, you will sell it at 600 (give or take - as an individual investor, the spread won't affect your profits much, and a limit trade will protect you against major volatility). If you want to hold it till it reaches 700, no algorithmic trading or flash crashes will have any effect on long term value of your stock. So, the only \"problem\" being solved here is perception that evil greedy trading companies are making \"unjust\" profits (the fact that said profits are more likely than not are made at the expense of competing evil greedy trading companies and not individual investors seems to be lost on the people who proposing this without having a clue about the topic they are talking about). Oh, and there are other people who will be harmed - people whose income/wealth (you know, those evil investors like retirees) depends on how efficiently asset managers (who also use algorithmic trading) manage their retirement funds/ETFs. You don't REALLY think that they will just eat up the tax instead of passing it onto the investors in the form of lower returns, right?"
874,Is there any possibility to have a democracy inherently discourage lobbying?,NEGATIVE,"Can a democratic system be structured in a way that doesn't rely on ethics or brute-force, police-state-esque measures to disable lobbying? Is there a way to inherently make lobbying unattractive/unfeasible without external control? Any level of a democracy may be altered to result in such a system. For instance, if somehow the existing voting system could limit lobbying, which one would be best? If possible, I would like to see some mathematical models as simulation evidence. Even better, of course, would be empirical evidence in an actual implementation case, but I rather doubt that exists. I especially would like to see the response of a given system to noise. So, given that somebody already is lobbying, how would you avoid others joining in or even overcome the lobbying goal to cause a result more true to the (informed) majority's opinion? (Of course, there may be instances where a lobbying faction happens to have goals that actually do help the general public and is favorable to the majority. In that case, the results shouldn't change no matter whether a faction lobbies or not.)"
875,"",NEGATIVE,"Yes, there is one way to do it. And, barring police state, only one reliable effective way, considering the fact that humans respond to incentives and cost/benefit ratios present a very powerful incentive. The way to do it is very simple: Lobbying is asking the government to use its power in a way beneficial to a specific individual/organization. The best solution to prevent this is to make sure that the government has no power - including budgetary - to use in any way that would benefit someone. This way, there's nothing to lobby FOR. As an example, if a government can tax people, and out of the money raised with those taxes decide to build an infrastructure item X, it now has the power to decide which company gets chosen to build X - and get paid for it. If the project nets the company $100Mil, spending $100K on lobbying to make sure you get the project is a very good investment! If the government was prevented from being able to commission building an infrastructure item X (such as, for example, by Constitutional amendment which strips away any powers not explicitly allowed), then there would be nothing for the builders of X infrastructure to lobby the government for (as opposed to those builders trying and selling the idea/project to the people who want to buy that piece of infrastructure). In essence, the less power (and the less budget) the government has, the less corruption and lobbying there will be. As a converse, it doesn't matter WHAT you do, as soon as you grant more power/more budgets to the government, it will ALWAYS be more cost effective for someone to spend X amount of money on lobbying to obtain a lot more than X in government preferential treatment. As a second example: If the law says \"Every company's income gets taxed at 15%. No ifs, ands, or buts, no exceptions, no special rules.\" You now have zero reason for a company/industry to lobby to change the rules some special way to benefit that specific company at the expense of competitors, or their whole industry at the \"expense\" of tax revenue. If on the other hand, your government has the power to tweak the laws so that some companies are able to save billions of dollars on taxes (*cough*GE*cough*), that company has an interest - hell, fiduciary duty to its shareholders - to spend up to that same couple of billion lobbying so that tax laws are structured to preserve and enhance that ability to save billions in taxes. Which is EXACTLY what GE did (hundreds of millions of dollars spent on lobbying)."
876,"",NEGATIVE,"The problem you are running into is the conflation of \"lobbying\" and \"special interests.\" Lobbying, at its most basic form, is attempting to influence a representative to vote a certain way. An election is really nothing more than a special case of lobbying - only instead of influencing a representative, you are attempting to influence all voters. A \"special interest group\" is a group of people that organize around a narrow issue, typically for the purposes of magnifying their ability to influence legislation. Ultimately, all lobbying does is \"do the work\" of democracy - it makes people's voices heard. When we fret over the \"outsized influence of special interests,\" we are decrying the fact that the \"average guy's\" voice is being drawn out by money. When we see bribery and corruption, that is clearly \"against the rules,\" but done according to the rules, lobbying is just effective influence. From a pragmatic point of view then, the best kind of rules are those do not hinder the voice, but expose when the game is unfair. There's an old saying \"Sunlight is the best disinfectant,\" meaning that when things are exposed to the light of day, then tend to clean things up. (Have to say, the New Testament pioneered this, saying, \"Men love darkness rather than light\", but I digress.) If, for example, an special interest group is receiving 96% of its funding from, say, Westboro Baptist Church, the principle of free speech (and Buckley v. Valeo) would say that prohibiting such donations is bad. At the same, the political blowback from exposing said fact tends to blunt said money's impact. Transparency, then, rather than legislation, is probably your best bet. Now, writing a letter to your Congressman is also lobbying. Indeed as this podcast shows, when a Congressman is choosing between money from a big powerful interest group or the letters from his constituents, he'll choose the letters every time. Indeed, special interest groups are most effective when they get real voters to do just that - write their Congressmen. And that's the problem - what you call a special interest is what I call \"my interest,\" and vice versa. A lobbyist, a special interest group - all they are doing is being better at getting their voice heard than the guy who isn't focused. I say this to answer your question thus, that lobbying is democracy, at its best. Any attempt to call it otherwise would be restrict the whole raison d'etre of democracy - to make your voice heard."
877,What are the advantages of a VAT over a normal sales tax?,NEGATIVE,"In the United States, most consumers are used to paying a sales tax - a couple of percentage points per dollar of goods sold - that are used to fund government. By contrast, Europeans pay a \"VAT\" - a value added tax - a more complicated scheme by which each time a product changes hands in the business development cycle, a portion of the added value is taxed and used for funding. What is the benefit of doing this?"
878,"",NEGATIVE,"Technically speaking, there is no such thing as a federal police force. There are U.S. Marshalls, FBI Agents, Drug Enforcement Agents, ATF Agents, Border Patrol, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, but there is no such thing as a federal police. (Okay, the U.S. Capitol Police Force, maybe, but I doubt that's really the issue here.) Ultimately, federal laws trump state laws, so each of these agencies has something to hold over the heads of local authorities, but in the end, each of these agencies ultimately relies on individually negotiated agreements with local authorities to be able to operate. For this reason, local sheriffs can, if they so decide, choose not to participate in a given action. Indeed, in many anti-immigrant states, the problem is often the reverse - local authorities are demanding the right to enforce federal laws, and at least if the case of Alabama and Arizona is considered, they aren't allowed to. The Arizona v. United States decision aka \"Show Me Your Papers\" was the result of state authorities attempting to enforce a federal law. Most of it was struck down, because it was too much of an entaglement between the different types of government. The converse also holds. If DEA wants to raid a Colorado \"dispensary,\" they have to supply the agents to do it. Colorado cannot legally bar the DEA agents from doing their job, but they are under no obligation to enforce it either. Indeed, in a famous incident in 1963, Alabama's Governor, George Wallace symbolically stood in the schoolhouse door attempting to prevent federalized national guard troops from enforcing a Supreme Court decision integrating schools. Had the governor wished, he would have had the authority to call in local police to stop them as well - although doing so would have been a treasonous act and likely could have precipitated another Civil War. It is that fear that, in practice, forces federal and state forces to cooperate. Nullification is no longer a valid argument, but neither has state soverignity been abolished. Federal laws are supreme, but states are not obligated to enforce them. They just can't stand in the way without bringing down much wider consequences."
879,"",NEGATIVE,"Local law enforcement officials have enforcement jurisdictions that are limited by the local (state or municipality) government's legal jurisdiction. That is, the power they are granted as a representative of a specific governmental entity can only extend so far as the legal jurisdiction of that government. Specifically, that means that local law enforcement officials are not authorized to enforce federal law (except in specific cases where the federal entity that has jurisdiction over the law extends power/deputizes the local official) of any kind. You wouldn't expect a local police officer in New York to be able to arrest a Canadian citizen for a violation of Canadian law while in the state, and the same applies to violators of federal law within the state. However, in practical terms that rarely makes much of a difference to offenders, because almost all federal criminal law has a parallel state/local law. When you are arrested by a local official, charges are then filed against the local statute. Federal charges may be filed later based on the evidence available from the local officer, but those are filed and carried out by federal officials who have that power. In the rare cases where state law does not mimic federal law is the only time you would have this conflict play out in practical circumstances though. So to answer your questions: No, the local police not only do not have to prosecute people for activity that is legal in the state but illegal at the federal level but they are not permitted to. Nor are local officers required to act in any way contrary to their own laws. However, local police have no power to stop enforcement of federal laws by federal law enforcement personnel in their states. They do not need to help the federal law enforcement agents, but they can be arrested themselves for impeding a federal investigation if they do things to delay or prevent the lawful arrest of state citizens by federal enforcement agents. The Constitution tries to make this a non-issue through the Supremacy Clause (indicating that any state law in conflict with a federal law is unconstitutional and superseded by the federal law), however, it will take a court challenge to resolve the specific issues you highlighted so my answer will apply while this works its way through the courts. There are also some areas of law (immigration for example) where the state does not have the authority to make any law (even one in concert with federal law). In these cases federal officers typically pass that authority to local officers for logistical purposes."
880,What is the status of the proposed extension of passenger railroads in the US?,NEGATIVE,"From a European perspective, I have the impression that in most of the USA, intercity passenger rail travel is mestly a touristic endeavour, and not used for \"ordinary\" intercity travel as it is in Europe and Asia (including in those parts of Russia that are as sparsely populated as parts of the US, so it's not exclusively a matter of population density). But, Amtrak ridership is growing and there are a number of initiatives for an extension of passenger railroad. For example: Iowa City - Chicago Passenger Rail Midwest Regional Rail Initiative Western High Speed Rail Alliance More can be found here. What is the status of those initiatives? Of course, it's easy for local legislators to come together for a \"future of our region\" conference and perhaps spend a few million on a feasability study concluding that a railroad (paid with somebody elses money) would benefit their region. And some proposals are outright ridiculous. The question is, therefore: are those all just feasability studies etc., or are things actually happening? How much money is being budgeted by decision-takers who would fund such an investment? Have any decisions been taken on significant expansions on passenger rail travel, or is it all just words?"
881,Are there any proposals for a significant electrification of US railroads?,NEGATIVE,"Most of the railroads in the United States are not electrified. I can't find figures right now, but I don't think it's much. In the past decade, fuel prices have risen, Amtrak ridership has increased significantly, and there are many proposals to extend the railroad network. Currently, Denmark is planning to electrify many of its unelectrified railways. Are there any active plans for a significant electrification of railroad infrastructure in the United States?"
882,"",NEGATIVE,"In the US there are thousands of jurisdictions levying sales tax. In Europe VAT is always paid to the same taxing agency, thus the value added accounting is relatively simple. Worst case you buy in EU country X and sell in EU country Y, but most of the businesses operate within the same country. Only one taxing agency to talk to. In the US a business can buy in Los Angeles and sell in New York City, thus the VAT accounting would be between the following entities: The County of Los Angeles (sales tax rate of 1.5%) The State of California (sales tax rate of 7.5%) The State of New York (sales tax rate of 4%) The City of New York (sales tax rate of 4.875%). Add to that potential Federal accounting (currently there's no Federal sales tax or VAT). The benefit of VAT in Europe on the other hand is simplifying the compliance. Businesses do not need to check exemptions and such, and always charge and remit the differential VAT, thus ensuring the VAT is properly collected. The Wikipedia article explains this point very well."
883,Why is proportional representation not considered in any of the US states?,NEGATIVE,"While the Americans agree that the current two-party system is broken, I have not heard any real voices on changing it in any State. States like California, New York or Texas, which send large Congressional delegations, could easily afford switching to a proportional representation system leaving the personal elections only for Senators. Why hasn't it been considered? Edit: I do not consider redistricting a solution to the problem. The question is not about how to allow the people who want to get elected create a district where that can happen, but why the Americans don't want to consider an alternative system where they can have more than 1 seat for grabs at any given constituency, thus allowing broader range of opinions to be represented. Similarly, one would also co-relate this question to the question of why we still have the Electoral College, when there's no excuse left for its existence other than the convenience of the current political establishment. While in the 18th century one would understand the need for redistricting and indirect elections, in the 21st - there's no real need for it, yet there's no real conversation about the alternatives."
884,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"I would posit that while the two party system may broken (and I am not sure that everyone would agree with that), the cause is not proportional voting (or the lack thereof). The problem that you mention is meant to be solved through redistricting. This will enable effectively proportional representation (where the number of representatives from each party approximately represents the votes that they got, but is not apportioned that way). The only way that people will will never \"not have a vote\" is if either: Every district only has members of a given party In a proportional system, every time there is a vote, it works out to exactly the required fractions (so that no votes are wasted going over or under that amount). Any method you pick (other than direct democracy) will have these kinds of problems. They are not the fault of the two party system (as they would exist with 3 or 4 parties as well) and the problem that you mention in the comments is effectively unavoidable."
885,"",NEGATIVE,"First, the premise of this question is not 100% correct. States have considered proportional representation with respect to their delegations to the Electoral College. Specifically, state level California Republicans had been pushing an effort in the legislature there to assign California's 55 electors by proportion of the popular vote to give them an opportunity to win some votes in a state with 12% of the national population that they haven't had success winning in a generation. Ultimately, California agreed to give their votes to the national popular vote winner, as soon as enough states have done the same to reach a majority of electoral college votes. However, the reason that no state has considered a proportional approach at the congressional level is because of the nature of redistricting in the United States. However, redistricting is not the solution to getting to a system that is more proportional than the current model, it is explicitly the reason that no state would consider such a model. In Vieth v. Jubelirer the Supreme Court held that drawing political districts with the sole intent of ensuring that a particular political party was advantaged is perfectly constitutional. In the case two Pennsylvania Democrats challenged the state's Republican controlled state legislature for denying the principle of \"one person one vote\" to them by ensuring their votes would be less likely to impact their representation in a heavily Republican district. In its ruling the Court ruled the districts Constitutional because political affiliation was not an immutable trait or protected class and there was no criteria for adjudicated a more fair system. Therefore, in order to move to a proportional representation system, you would need the state officials in charge of drawing congressional districts (traditionally the state legislature) to draw districts against their own interests when it is perfectly legal to blatantly draw them in your favor (so long as you don't do so in such a way as to not explicitly dilute the power of some actual protected class, i.e. race, gender, etc.). Not only that, but given that districts are only drawn once every 10 years, there is nothing to ensure that the wishes of an altruistic legislature of one party will see those decisions respected when the next legislature takes a look at the map. What states have been doing to combat this problem in such a way as to limit the impact of either political party's influence for the long term is to take the redistricting power away from the legislatures and give it to private non-partisan redistricting commissions. You can see my answer to this question to see a discussion of examples of such proposed commissions in Ohio and California. Some tool like this will need to be put in place broadly before you will see any states begin to move toward a more representative congressional delegation."
887,"",NEGATIVE,"In the absence of Supreme Court precedent on the topic, it appears the January 25th, 2013 ruling on this matter by the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will remain the definitive answer to this question unless and until the Supreme Court chooses to hear this case. The ruling addressed 3 appointments to the National Labor Relations Board made on the same day as the Richard Cordray appointment. From the POLITICO article, in their holding, the Appeals Court said: \"[T]he President made his three appointments to the Board on January 4, 2012, after Congress began a new session on January 3 and while that new session continued,\" the court wrote in its decision. \"Considering the text, history, and structure of the Constitution, these appointments were invalid from their inception.\" So the law of the land is (at least currently), that pro forma sessions constitute real Congressional sessions for the purpose of identifying Constitutional \"recesses\". In NLRB v. Canning, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed this decision."
890,What is the debt ceiling and what happens if we reach it?,NEGATIVE,"Over the past few years, there has been debate in congress as to whether or not to raise the debt ceiling. My question is simple(the answer to it might not be): What Is the debt ceiling, under what circumstances does it come into play, and what happens if we reach it? I've heard multiple explanations. Some explanations suggest that reaching the debt ceiling means that the US government won't pay it's employees. Some explanations suggest that reaching the debt ceiling means that the US government won't repay it's loans. Some explanations suggest that reaching the debt ceiling means that the US government will not pay for programs that it has already budgeted for. Some have also said that the debt ceiling legislation is unconstitutional according to section 4 of the 14th amendment. Is this the case? Section 4 of the 14th amendment: The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void."
891,"",NEGATIVE,"The debt ceiling is the largest amount of the outstanding debt the US is allowed to have. Reaching the debt ceiling severely impacts the US Treasury cash-flow options, and the result is that it can default on some of the obligations. This is similar to any other entity that has assets, liabilities, revenues and debts. You may have $1M in assets and $10 in liabilities, but your assets are non-liquid and your liabilities are due. You have $0 cash to pay the $10, so no matter how many assets you have - you're bankrupt. The US government borrows cash to pay current liabilities on the account of the future revenue stream. So if it cannot borrow (after reaching the debt ceiling), it will have only to rely on the revenue stream, which is not steady enough (or just enough, if there's a budget deficit) to cover the current liabilities. Hence - default. As to what exactly happens, it depends on the treasury's decision on what to default. They may default on payroll obligations, or on debt repayment obligations, or on other stuff, at their choosing. All of the three possibilities (and other) you mentioned are possible. As to the Constitution - basically the concept of debt ceiling potentially violates the Constitution as it limits the ability of the government to repay its debt. But it appears that both the executive branch (the President) and the legislative branch (the Congress) don't want the judicial branch (the Supreme Court) to rule on this as it will limit the influence of one on the other, which they don't want to happen. Congress wants the ability to make threats re the debt ceiling and is not interested in the Supreme Court declaring it as unconstitutional, and the President wants the ability to threaten the Congress with ignoring the debt ceiling based on the Constitution, thus is not interested in the Supreme Court declaring it as constitutional. Generally all the US debt is based on the Government spending, which in turn is based on the laws of Congress. So the debt ceiling is basically a way of Congress to say \"We told you to pay for X, but we only allow you to spend Y, and if Y is not enough for X - we don't care\"."
892,"",NEGATIVE,"It's simply another solution. You have to organize tax system in some way, and there are many ways to achieve that. The main idea behind VAT tax is that you never pay it twice. You're obliged to pay the VAT as soon as you have issued an invoice, but you can substract from that sum the VAT you've paid to you supplier etc. There are 2 alternate solution, paying a tax based on sales - than each time the product changes the owner, the tax have to be paid in full sum. Such solution makes outsourcing less profitable, and long supplier chains completely unprofitable. Second is to tax only when the product is sold to private person - end consumer. It promotes outsourcing, such as VAT, but the problem is as long as the good is in storage, the tax is not paid. VAT joins the benefits on both of those systems. The tax is never paid twice, but it is paid on each production level as soon as the invoice is issued, so it provides constant cash flow to the government. You're asking for benefits only, but there are also big disadvantages. VAT is relatively easy to collect, but expensive to pay - because of the complications, many even small companies are forced to hire an accountant. It is also vulnerable to fake invoices, there are organised crime groups which are specialized in taking money from government because of fake invoices - because VAT works so, that if you have paid to you contrahents more as you are about to pay, the government pays you back the difference."
893,"",NEGATIVE,"The problem with the lobbying is that people choose their representatives to represent the interests of the voters. Each voter has the same importance, when choosing the representative. But once the representative is chosen, he/she may be influences by some group, to make him/her treat the interests of that group with higher priority than the interests of other groups. The output is, that, in theory, every citizen has the same rights and the same influence on government, because everyone has the same vote. But because we rule through the representatives, more influence are those people, who are nearer those representatives. Possible solutions: 1) more direct democracy, more referendums. But this is very costly, so unless there will be real e-democracy, it's hardly to imagine organizing referendum for every important decision made in parliament. 2) more transparency. If the people learn, for example, that representative X is often meeting with the director of company producing solar panels, they will be less likely to accept 'renewable-resources-policy'. Also hard, because representatives should also have some privacy, and not cameras installed in bathroom... What will be not solved: Lobbying is targeted to manipulate politicians. But mass media are targeted to manipulate the whole society. If we limit lobbying, we'll have the increase of intensity of media manipulation."
894,Are people more likely to seek out news sources they agree with?,NEGATIVE,"Anecdotal evidence certainly suggests that people are more comfortable hearing politically controversial information from sources they already agree with. Such is the business model of MSNBC on the left and Fox News on the right. Is there any scientific evidence that suggests people are indeed more likely to believe things told to them by people who agree with them? Or, is it an entire ecosystem of advertising and more traditional persuasive techniques (i.e. sex, violence, etc.) that draws in audiences. Finally, if there is a correlation between ideology and information selection, what accounts for the difference between political affiliation throughout the country and the relative market share between Fox News and MSNBC?"
895,"If a governor or senator is chosen as a running mate (VP) to a president candidate, and that candidate loses, what happens?",VERY_NEGATIVE,"If a governor or senator is chosen as a running mate (VP) to a president candidate, and that candidate loses, do they go back to their post as governor or senator?"
897,"",NEGATIVE,"Nothing happens. They don't \"go back\", they never leave. They're running the elections while continuing holding the job. Only if won, they resign from the previous position (sometimes not immediately, for example the current Lieutenant Governor of California stayed a couple of more days as the Mayor of San Francisco and had to be sworn in as Lt. Governor separately from Jerry Brown because of that)."
899,"",NEGATIVE,"Nothing happens until the member resigns. In 2008, for example, both candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, were sitting U.S. Senators (incidentally, it was the first such time this ever happened). After the election, Barack Obama, the victor, constitutionally prohibited from holding both offices, resigned as Senator (causing Blagoveich to have 'F**n gold!'), and John McCain resumed his duties. Indeed, Obama scored some points off of McCain in October because of this. During the midst of the economic \"meltdown,\" McCain thought it would score him some points to announce to the world that he was going to stop campaigning for a few days to return to the Senate, due to the seriousness of the event. He called on Obama to do the same - but Obama did not. Instead, Obama ridiculed McCain for \"being unable to juggle\" multiple hot button items. He claimed that as President, there wouldn't be the chance to let things cool down, insinuating that McCain would be an ineffective multi-tasker. As a second example, Paul Ryan, in 2012, ran two campaigns. In the first, he ran for vice-president, in the second, as a Congressman from Wisconsin. He won the latter, but not the former. About the only time this was an issue was in 1996, when the Senate Majority Leader, Bob Dole, decided he needed to tell people that he really, really wanted to be President. So, he resigned his Senate seat early in order to campaign. In the end, he lost the vote for the Presidency, and because he had resigned his seat, just had to go home. Running for office has no bearing on your current office in any way. It's only if you win that adjustments need to be made."
901,"",NEGATIVE,"To find the confirmation of your these you can refer to social psychology, for example Robert Cialdini (Influence: Science and Practice). People are more likely to believe people they like. And they are more likely to like people that have similar points of view. So in fact especially when it comes to politics, people are likely to get stuck in the ideology they were once involved in. Note also the social dissonance effect. People like to know they are wiser and better than the others, which means they are right and others aren't. So they tend to filter the information which could prove that they could be wrong in some concepts, or that they are egoistic. So the investor will not be interested in watching documentary about the hard life of workers which were fired by his company in order to maximize profit."
902,What is the magnitude of election fraud in the US?,NEGATIVE,"I've recently been quite shocked to learn that in the US there is a serious amount of election fraud - at least in the presidential elections. Are there any numbers on the magnitude of this? I am deliberately not limiting this question to specific types of fraud, since there is quite a number of them, and I would be grateful to know about at least semi-serious calculations to estimate their effect, whether individually or all together. Examples are as follows. There is the design problem that it is completely unimportant whether 51% or 100% of the voters of a state vote for a candidate. I am aware that it is quite debatable to call this \"fraud\", but I am inclined to include this since it contradicts the equality of all votes as demanded by the human rights charta. Perhaps the worst problem: the introduction of loads of intransparent voting computers. These are often manufactured by Republican controlled companies, and there is not much of a chance of noticing flipping or miscounting votes. It is hard to verify those (but should not be!), but there are hints that there is something seriously wrong. The \"red shift\" - a statistically highly significant discrepancy between the official election results and polls done on the exit of the voting place - could prove this, but such polls are partially deliberately blocked or performed by the media without reliable disclosure if the results. (See also this question.) There are also some troublesome things that do have an influence on the outcome, but cannot exactly be called fraud unless you somehow manage to prove malicious intent. The magnitude of their effect would be very interesting, nevertheless. The voting is held on tuesday such that many poor people have problems attending. Similar effects might have the sometimes several hours long queues at voting booths in poorer districts. Gerrymandering, Caging sometimes loosing hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots Super PACs that can intransparently spend unlimited money on political campaigns. EDIT: This question was heavily edited to try to accomodate comments"
904,Is the human rights group Amnesty International perceived as liberal in the United States?,NEGATIVE,"In a mini-debate as to the reliability of Amnesty International as an objective source, I came across a post on Skeptics SE commenting the issue as follows: The problem is that, much like global warming, evolution and the like, proponents of the death penalty will renounce it as \"obvious liberal bias by bleeding-hearts interest groups\" because of it I've always perceived that the only entitities opposing Amnesty International or disagreeing with them, are entities commiting human rights violations. However, I'm not very much exposed to (neo-)conservative views in the United States. In Europe, I've never seen political opposition against Amnesty International, except from a few governments with a questionable democratic record. This leads me to my question: In the United States, is there any significant \"opposition\" against Amnesty International? For example, are there any significant political groups or pressure groups that denounce reports from Amnesty as \"liberal bias\"?"
907,"",NEGATIVE,"It could be because Amnesty International supports defensive jihad, although the timing for when AI was considered liberal might be off. Conservatives usually do not like to associate with people whose principles they deplore. This is probably similar to why even though the original mission of the Southern Poverty Law Center was to eliminate hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, them seem to have overstepped so that now almost any group could be considered a hate group. A simmering dispute over collaboration between Amnesty International and a former Guantanamo Bay detainee with Taliban sympathies has heated up after a senior Amnesty official argued that “defensive jihad” is not antithetical to human rights."
909,"",NEGATIVE,"In the United States there are not any pressure groups organized specifically around the mission of combating Amnesty International, however, the concept of foreign aid in general is something that is traditionally viewed as a more liberal priority. Chiefly this is because many Republican Congressman, especially those who self-identify as \"Tea Party\" candidates openly campaign for the elimination of the foreign aid budget all together. As such, Amnesty International is lumped in with a series of other international aid groups that are viewed skeptically by the Republican party in the United States who would prefer to spend the limited money the government has in a domestic capacity. There is also some uneasiness from the conservatives about the role of international organizations in general. They value the sovereignty of the United States quite highly and are hesitant to join international organizations that would purport to make policies and enter into treaties that would remove some of the legislative authority of elected congressman and put it in the hands of non-citizens who are not responsible to the American electorate. This includes entities like the UN and NATO and is also quite similar to the concerns of many in Europe (the UK in particular) with respect to the EU. Finally, and I would argue least important of the three points, are the divisive positions they have taken in the past with respect to American efforts in Guantanamo, their relative support for Hamas as a peer to Isreal and recent support for abortion in the cases of rape and incest. These are at odds with the foreign policy beliefs of some in the Republican party and help contribute to a general skepticism about the organization. However, since there is no specific effort to combat Amnesty International, I would contend that this is much less important to those with concerns about the group than the broader points about America's position in the world generally."
910,"",NEGATIVE,"I am French and your question interested me so I read some articles about that. I'm not a political expert but maybe this can help you. As you noticed, president Mitterrand (left wing) decided in 1985 to include proportionality after losing the cantonal elections (second-level districts) in order to limit the damages for his political party in the 1986 legislative elections. Note that including proportionality representation was also one of his campaign promises when he was elected in 1981. However Chirac's party (right wing) won the 1986 legislative election and he became Prime Minister. One of his first decisions was to remove proportionality voting. To do so, he used article 49.3 of Constitution¹, allowing him to bypass the Assembly's vote. Proportionality gave more than 30 seats to the extreme right (instead of 1 or 2), and it is known that Chirac has always firmly fought the extreme right. So to answer simply I would say it's according to the will of political leading party. You can see on this article in French from Le Figaro what the 2012 French Assembly would look like with and without proportionality. The extreme right would have 85 seats instead of 3 and the extrem left 30 instead of 10. They are the parties demanding proportionality. One of the promises of our current President Hollande (left) is to include \"partial\" proportionality. ¹ The article 49.3 of the Constitution giving the possibility to the government to bypass a vote at the Assembly is considered as anti-democratic by many people, it has been restrained in 2008."
911,"",NEGATIVE,"To answer your question directly, the debt ceiling really doesn't determine which priorities will be funded or not funded, so we cannot say with certainty which of the options you list would happen were the debt limit to be breached. The debt limit is merely the statutory limit (not a Constitutional requirement, but one created by Congress) on the amount of money the Treasury Department can borrow. It in no way authorizes additional spending, it just enables the Treasury Department to physically have enough cash on hand to pay all the bills (for services already rendered) when they come do. In these cases, the commitment to pay the money was made at some point in the past, on credit, the requested services were performed, and now the bill is due. Additionally, Treasury is constantly collecting revenues throughout the year, so the government would never reach a point of zero cash on hand. The issue is that the amount of cash on hand on a given day would be less than the total due. It is then up to the Secretary of the Treasury to decide which bills to pay and which to ignore. In all likelihood, he would choose to pay the interest on the debt, bond holders and other secured creditors first in order to minimize the overall effect on our credit rating and economy. This makes the second bullet in your question the least likely, but that is entirely up to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury in the end. The Constitutional question is one for the Supreme Court to rule on, but it is important to note that the clause in question was a provision added during Reconstruction as states rejoined the Union with significant debts from financing the civil war. It was an attempt by Congress (at a time when the United States credit rating was still being established on the world stage) to assure other countries that the money they loaned to the now defunct Confederate States of America would be honored by the United States of America and paid on time and in full. As such, its relation to the debt ceiling (which originated after) has never been tested."
912,"",NEGATIVE,"By and large, election fraud, to the extent that it exists, should still be characterised as anecdotal, rather than widespread. This article, for example, points out a few supposed irregularities in the Ohio vote. Another advocacy group True The Vote, purports a more wholistic approach to reporting, but again, I would argue that these \"facts\" should be considered \"truthy\" rather than Truth(TM). I say this both as a former voter registrar and as a Republican - certain interests (namely Republicans) have a vested interest in promoting the perception that election fraud is widespread. So-called \"voter ID\" laws are seen by some as an \"attempt to disenfanchise voters\" for whom obtaining proper identification would pose an \"undue burden.\" Put another way, some people think that mean-spirited Republicans want to keep poor Democrats who can't afford the time off to renew their Drivers license from voting, thus decreasing Democratic turnout. In contrast, Republicans tend to claim high election fraud, they say, out of of pure motives to keep elections \"fair and balanced.\" Full Disclosure: I think both sides have some validity, but my personal experience is that the whole issue is overblown on both sides. The truth is that most elections are won with margins of more than 1%, and very few outlets think that voter fraud exceeds 1%. Is any fraud bad? Of course. And, there are no numbers that show systematic bias of voter fraud towards either party. Realistically speaking, in the United States, there is very little evidence that what discrepancies do exist would regularly change the outcome of elections. Again, are there races decided by a single vote or two? Sure. Indeed, one can honestly and accurately say that the election of George W. Bush hinged on 537 votes in Florida. But these are the exceptions, not the norm."
913,Who are early critics of democracy?,NEGATIVE,"I've been reading Henry David Thoreau's Resistance to Civil Government recently. It's a very interesting essay from 1849 and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in progressive thoughts on democratic theory. I was wondering if there are more early philosophers/critics of modern* democracy from the 19th century or maybe earlier? Or any literature from that time that I really should know? *) \"modern\" in terms of not ancient greek forms of democracy. Some additions/clarifications. I'm not a native english speaker, maybe I confuse some words. By critics I not necessarily mean to be against something. I'm also talking about constructive criticism. Okay, maybe Thoreau is more than that. But his thoughts on the 19th century U.S. politics can be read quite constructive. Well, here is one example. Thoreau said a major problem of democracy was/is that a legitimated majority can rule over any minority. It's not good sense/ intellect ruling over will to power/violence but majorities over minorities. Thoreau might be the more deconstructive type of critic, but there is so much truth in it. Have a look at Egypt for instance. Young people losing their lives on the streets fighting for more freedom, and what do they get after legit democratic elections? But I don't want to go offtopic now. I'm looking for literature similar to Thoreau's thoughts as explained above. Nietzsche might be a good start, I've not been digging deep into his work."
914,Has sharia ever been introduced by democratic means?,NEGATIVE,"Sharia, as defined by its Wikipedia article, is the moral code and religious law of Islam. Views on the compatibility of Sharia with democracy differ. From the same article: Legal scholar L. Ali Khan argues that \"constitutional orders founded on the principles of sharia are fully compatible with democracy, provided that religious minorities are protected and the incumbent Islamic leadership remains committed to the right to recall\". but the European Court of Human Rights determined that \"sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy\". The question of whether any dictatorships have been elected democratically is an old one. My question is — has sharia ever anywhere been introduced in a democratic process?"
915,"",NEGATIVE,"The obvious example would be Nietzsche. As an example of his thoughts on democracy, in Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future, he writes: We, who hold a different belief—we, who regard the democratic movement, not only as a degenerating form of political organization, but as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of man, as involving his mediocrising and depreciation: where have WE to fix our hopes? In NEW PHILOSOPHERS—there is no other alternative: in minds strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvalue and invert 'eternal valuations'; in forerunners, in men of the future, who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will compel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future of humanity as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of 'history' (the folly of the 'greatest number' is only its last form)—for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will some time or other be needed, at the very idea of which everything that has existed in the way of occult, terrible, and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed. The image of such leaders hovers before OUR eyes:—is it lawful for me to say it aloud, ye free spirits? The conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a CONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such responsibility; and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the dreadful danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate:—these are OUR real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits! these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined, or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger of 'man' himself DETERIORATING, he who like us has recognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in respect to the future of mankind—a game in which neither the hand, nor even a 'finger of God' has participated!—he who divines the fate that is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of 'modern ideas,' and still more under the whole of Christo-European morality—suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared. He sees at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and arrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and how often in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions and new paths:—he knows still better from his painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become contemptible. The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of the 'man of the future'—as idealized by the socialistic fools and shallow-pates—this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal (or as they call it, to a man of 'free society'), this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is undoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to its ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of mankind—and perhaps also a new MISSION! Source: Beyond Good and Evil, by Friedrich Nietzsche, translated by Helen Zimmern, Project Gutenberg Nietzsche considered democracy a manifestation of slave morality, one that severely limits the human potential. If you are interested in further exploring Nietzsche's philosophy, our sister site Philosophy.SE would be a great place to start: Which of Nietzsche writing would be a good introduction to his work? How does Nietzsche define and characterize “freedom” throughout his works? Is Nietzsche suggesting that the “free spirit” is a democrat in On the Genealogy of Morals? What are the major differences between Nietzsche and Plato?"
916,"",NEGATIVE,"There are two different ways of looking at this. First, whether Sharia as a theological concept has anything to do with social structure and governance, and are the overall high level concepts compatible with democratic socisal and governing structure. A good answer should cover that, but I don't think I can do this topic justice and therefore will concentrate on the second approach. A second approach is to see whether specific precepts of Sharia are in conflict with either overall democratic principles, or with what are generally considered a basic required set of human rights required in a modern democratic society (even if those rights aren't really explicitly implied by a mere concept of democratic political organization per se). Here, we can easily see a couple of immediate conflicts: A full blown correct implementation of Sharia is incompatible with one of the main tenets of modern \"democratic ways\" - namely, a human right known as \"freedom of religion\". Laws prohibiting religious conversion run contrary to Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. In contrast, Sharia has a concept known as \"apostasy\". Apostasy in Islam (Arabic: ردة‎ riddah, literally means: \"relapse\" or \"regress\" but usually translates to \"apostasy\", or ارتداد irtidād) is commonly defined in Islam as the rejection in word or deed of one's former religion (apostasy) by a person who was previously a follower of Islam. Islamic scholarship differs on its punishment, ranging from execution – based on an interpretation of certain hadiths – to no punishment at all as long as they \"do not work against the Muslim society or nation.\" The majority of Muslim scholars hold to the traditional view that apostasy is punishable by death or imprisonment until repentance, at least for adult men of sound mind. (I'm aware that there are some dissent to the idea in Islamic jurisprudence, but to quote Wiki again, \"these minority opinions have not found broad acceptance among the majority of Islamic scholars\"). As a random recent example, recently a family in Egypt was sentenced to 15 years in jail for attempting to change their names on documents back to their Christian names. A significantly better list of examples from many countries can be found on Wikipedia. However, again I'd like to caveat this with the fact that the answer does NOT contain any proof that \"democratic ways\" - as the OP put it - in some way includes as a necessary requirement to follow Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and thus can be succeptible to critique on that basis barring clarification from OP."
917,Are there any truly EU-level political parties?,NEGATIVE,"In the European Parliament, parties operate as groups of national parties, see e.g. current europarties. They don't take members and don't operate in countries where they don't have any membership party. They're rather organisational vehicles for parliamentary work than true parties. Are there any truly EU-level political parties? By truly EU-level, I mean that they operate on EU-level in a way analogous to how traditional parties operate on a national level. For example, aiming to operate everywhere in the EU, allowing membership from anyone in the EU, and encouraging members anywhere in the EU to start local sections (at local, regional, or national sections). The list linked above only includes parties currently represented in the European Parliament. I know that no party according to my criteria currently has any representation, but are there any that are presently without representation?"
918,"Does it cost $25 to obtain a \"free\" Voter ID in any state?",NEGATIVE,"This article at pbs.org seems to indicate that getting a free Voter ID in a state can cost as much as $25. Voting law advocates contend these laws disproportionately affect elderly, minority and low-income groups that tend to vote Democratic [sic]. Obtaining photo ID can be costly and burdensome, with even free state ID requiring documents like a birth certificate that can cost up to $25 in some places. I cannot seem to rectify that claim with this Voter ID laws by state, where every state seems to have an option to provide proof of eligibility that doesn't require any money. Is this claim a misrepresentation of Voter ID requirements? (I.e. The claims are:) These [VoterID] laws disproportionately affect elderly, minority and low-income groups Obtaining photo ID can be costly and burdensome (where costly is defined as \"$25\", and burdensome is defined as \"unable to vote due to the requirement of obtaining iD\") (I.e. Are anti-VoterID advocates just claiming that birth certificates can cost as much as $25. Voter ID laws require documents, an example of which is a birth certificate or utility bill, and they are just using the more expensive example.)"
920,Did any political campaign in USA ever officially acknowledge practically using Nate Silver's model or numbers?,NEGATIVE,"Did any political campaign in USA ever officially acknowledge practically using Nate Silver's (of 538 blog) models and/or numbers in some way, at least to check their own polls/predictons? If it was just a campaign member who did it (as opposed to a policy of the whole campaign), it's in-scope as long as the practical effect was meaningful (e.g., it informed the decisions of a fairly-important campaign member)."
925,"",NEGATIVE,"The difficulty you are having with squaring the burden to getting a photo ID with the fact that \"...every state seems to have an option to provide proof of eligibility that doesn't require any money\" is because it is not accurate to say that every state has an alternative to the photo ID. Looking more closely at the NCSL source that you quoted in the question, you can see that Georgia, Tennessee, and Kansas fall into the category of \"Strict Photo\" and will accept only a photo ID before counting someone's vote. It is true that each state will allow the voter to cast a provisional ballot if they did not have the ID with them at the time of voting, but they each require the voter to show proof of the photo ID within several days of the election in order for the ballot to be counted. From the NCSL's analysis: Kansas: A voter who is unable or refuses to provide current and valid identification may vote a provisional ballot. To have his or her ballot counted, the voter must provide a valid form of identification to the county election officer in person or provide a copy by mail or electronic means before the meeting of the county board of canvassers. Tennessee: If a voter is unable to present the proper evidence of identification, then the voter will be entitled to vote by provisional ballot in the manner detailed in the bill. The provisional ballot will only be counted if the voter provides the proper evidence of identification to the administrator of elections or the administrator's designee by the close of business on the second business day after the election. Georgia: If you show up to vote and you do not have one of the acceptable forms of photo identification, you can still vote a provisional ballot. You will have up to three days after the election to present appropriate photo identification at your county registrar's office in order for your provisional ballot to be counted. With this in mind, looking at the real costs of obtaining a photo ID, we can see costs easily reach or pass the $25 threshold you highlighted. If you are a voter without a valid photo ID in one of these states the first challenge would be getting to the state license office to request one. A report from the Brennen Center and summarized in this Washington Post article found in an analysis of the 10 most restrictive states that: nearly half a million eligible voters in the 10 states do not have access to a vehicle and live more than 10 miles from their nearest state ID-issuing office. In addition to finding transportation to the office, they would need to schedule a time when they are not at work or other obligation AND when the office was open. The same report found that: Rural areas in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas are served by part-time ID offices. And in an extreme example, the researchers found the office in Sauk City, Wis., is open only on the fifth Wednesday of any month. That would limit the office to being open just four days this year. Finally, there is the cost of the documentation to secure the ID itself. The report said birth certificates can cost between $8 and $25. Marriage licenses, required in some states for married women whose birth certificates include a maiden name, can cost between $8 and $20."
926,"",NEGATIVE,"Because there is a general fear in the US that you would end up with the top congressmen picked by the party not necessarily someone who is going to represent your area. The candidates are even more beholden to the party and the problem of partisanship gets worse not better. Ideally which ever candidate is selected is going to go to congress and represent the best interests of their constituents. If the candidates are selected by the party as a whole for the state then you lose that. For instance regulations that are going to cripple the coal industry were voted against by Democrats from coal mining areas, despite their party's significant support for the measure. If the candidates were selected by the party then even though the candidates were in theory from West Virginia they are effectively from Washington DC and represent the Democratic Party. So instead they support legislation that is going to cripple the people that they are supposed to be representing. I suspect you would find with in 10 years that most of your congressional representatives chosen by the party would have lived in areas other than those being represented 5 years earlier. By the way it has been considered and proposed several times at state level including, the Illinois State Constitutional Convention that was called in 1970."
927,"",NEGATIVE,"The most effective way to reduce the power of the union is to reduce the corruption involved in running the union. The most effective way to reduce the corruption is to open it up and allow its members to see the what their leaders are doing with there dues. If union members knew how much money was being taken from them by the union leaders to line their own pockets, line the pockets of their friends, and spent on lobbyists for causes that most of the union may not support, then there would be calls for change. The power of the union would be tempered by the need to represent the workers, less they be removed and someone who will do more than lip service to the worker's needs and desires put in their place."
929,Why has the United States not signed and ratified the International Criminal Court?,NEGATIVE,"The International Criminal Court (ICC) treaty has been signed by 121 countries. A number of countries are not parties; China, Russia, United States. From the countries that are not parties to the ICC, the United States is one that often tends to associate itself with democracy and rule of law. Therefore, my question is specifically about why the US have not ratified, and not why Cuba, China or Saudi Arabia have not. Why have the United States not signed and ratified the International Criminal Court?"
931,What interests do Haiti and the AU have in Haitian associate membership?,NEGATIVE,"According to the Wikipedia page on African Union, Haiti is currently a member observer of the AU and current pending full Associate Member status due at the AU summit in July 2012 (sic). Haiti is in the Caribbean. What interest does Haiti have in (associate) membership of the African Union, and what interest does the African Union have in an association with Haiti?"
932,"",NEGATIVE,"International institutions (especially in the last 30 years) tend to be dominated by countries generally considered to be antagonistic to the interests of the Unites States. As such, US is rightfully worried that joining an institution which has a binding power over USA without any oversight or veto is bound to end up detrimental to its interests, with US citizens and leaders being convicted on a political ground by a body dominated by forces less interested in promoting justice and prosperity and more interested in \"screw the Great Satan\". Given the UN's track record, I don't see such worries as baseless: United Nations Disarmament Commission reelected Iran to the senior office of a vice chairman. The commission also elected Syria as its recording secretary. Elected Iran to Commission on the Status of Women North Korea chaired the Conference on Disarmament Iran elected as General Assembly vice president. Saudi Arabia to \"U.N. Women's board\" agency. Syria was appointed to two human-rights-related committees of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) even as the Syrian government was killing protesters in its own country. Given that - in the words of an Aussie newspaper covering one of these stories - \"lunatics are running the asylim\", there's a significant concern that ICC would end up exactly the same. Considering the repercussions to USA of subjecting itself to jurisdiction of such, it seems significantly more prudent to not join without some guarantee that ICC wouldn't turn into Yet Another OIC puppet. A separate but related concern is which laws would be applicable. As just one example, UNCHR seems to greatly care about an all-important right of having a religion not be offended (1 guess which religion's adherents push for that), with \"be offended\" being in the eye of beerholder. Should that view prevail, ICC might be used to circumvent freedom of speech enshrined in US Constitution's First Amendment."
933,"",NEGATIVE,"No state requires paying a fee to vote. If you are unable to pay the required costs associated with obtaining the documentation to prove you can legally vote (indigent), then those fees are waived. If you are unable to travel to vote, you can always vote absentee, and similarly those people are exempt from providing supporting documentation. Since a majority of states use the following forms of identification, \"A copy of a current Utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter.\" This has been abbreviated to HAVA2002. All 50 states use Help America Vote Act 2002 as a minimum for voter identification in Federal elections (president, senators, house of representatives, etc.). Regarding the cost of getting to the County Registrar's office. This argument is specious, especially with respect to Georgia, which Michael Kingsmill specifically used as an example in his comments before they were deleted. The Georgia Voter ID law was challenged in court. Georgia's SoS, Brian Kemp, who is required to investigate voter fraud notes that the law has withstood challenges in four courts. In one of those cases, the NAACP claimed, \"a large number of Georgia voters lack acceptable Photo ID..\" They failed to produce any plaintiffs that were incapable of going to their local registrar's office (all of them made trips of similar length on occasion). So, the court ruled that Photo ID requirement doesn't place an undue or significant burden on the right to vote: As the Rokita court noted, voters who lack Photo ID undoubtedly exist somewhere, but the fact that Plaintiffs, in spite of their efforts, have failed to uncover anyone \"who can attest to the fact that he/she will be prevented from voting\" provides significant support for a conclusion that the Photo ID requirement does not unduly burden the right to vote.

934,How often do elections occur on or near Yom Kippur?,NEGATIVE,"Julia Gillard has indicated that the Australian election will be held on September 14, which is the date Yom Kippur falls. This article says that no election has fallen on Yom Kippur since 1946, which is when the Australian Electoral Commission began recording election dates. I've also heard that there's never been a federal election held on Yom Kippur, though I don't have a citation for that. But I'm thinking that if you're looking only at Australian elections, there haven't been enough of them to determine whether that's just a matter of chance or not. If anyone's wondering, Jews will be able to vote beforehand, as usual, but it's been claimed some individuals who'd otherwise be involved in political campaigning in the final day (Sabbath notwithstanding) or days of the campaign will choose not to. In genuine democracies with a non-fixed date election, and a non-trivial Jewish population (unlike, say, India or Japan), how often are elections held on or near Yom Kippur, compared to what would happen by chance alone?"
935,Are internet petitions a practical way to accomplish grass roots political goals?,NEGATIVE,"Are internet petitions a practical way to accomplish grass roots political goals? For example, the White House has a mechanism to petition the president to take action. Are there some kinds of political goals that are better suited to being successfully accomplished by way of such petitions, for example, ideas that are accepted by the vast majority? Are such petitions values downplayed by politicians given the ease of collecting signatures? Are there particular styles of such petitions, such as with confirmed identity of signatories that are shown to be more successful, or very simple and non-controversial ideas that make good sense? In particular, the folks working against SOPA included in their work petitions. Google claims to have gathered over 7 million signatures against the act. Is there any evidence these petitions were significantly influential in the outcome? If so, does the ease of collecting signatures online mean that for an internet petition to be effective you must collect millions of signatures?"
936,"",NEGATIVE,"No, they are not, at least in the specific case of 2011 White House system. If you look at the responses to that White House site, any of the important ones are basically articulating existing policy positions of White House/Obama administration. On petitions that are being responded to, if the petition contradicts WH position, the reponse is a canned restatement of what Administration party line is, frequently not even tailored to actually respond to petition. In other words, such a site is a way for politicians in power to allow the people to feel important and vent, as opposed to being a tool to take a pulse of the nation and respond to popular wishes (or, at worst, to achieve its political goals - see below). If you petition for something important that the government wants to do, they would do it even without that petition. If you petition for something that they disagree with, they won't change their stance (and given the current US political climate, why should they when 50% of population holds views opposite to the other 50%?). As the most glaring example, they outright rejected building a Death Star :( This is being corroborated by a \"Time\" magazine post, discussing the origin of the system and the reasons WH likes it. While it has no good sources cited, Time is very pro-Obama in general so I'll tend to trust this somewhat less-than-flattering snippet: It started as little more than a whiteboard jot in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, a simple idea to get millions of Americans to contribute to the White House website. Imagine a scenario in which a gun-rights group starts a petition to tell Obama not to confiscate guns. “Wouldn’t it be great if we had the opportunity to respond to all these people directly and say we are not interested in doing that at all?” the White House staff mused. It would be a new digital main line to opponents, a way around organizations like the National Rifle Association. Notice something? It's not \"for Administration to hear the opinions of gun rights groups\". It's for them \"to be able to RESPOND to gun rights groups\". Another communication option for White House Press Secretary. If one is being even more cynical, such petitions can (and may be even are?) used by political operatives to make a pretense of popular support for the government policies. Since the opponents of a policy have no way to respond to pro-government petition, you basically make a very convincing pretense that a large portion of population agrees with it, without any sign that an equally large portion of population disagrees with it. This was done by \"letters to the editor from common people\" in former Soviet Union (e.g. the infamous Timashuk letter )"
938,"",NEGATIVE,"First, some technical background (which would help any other answers): Yom Kippur falls each year on the 10th day of the Jewish month of Tishrei, which is 9 days after the first day of Rosh Hashanah. In terms of the Gregorian calendar, the earliest date on which Yom Kippur can fall is September 14, as happened in 1899 and will happen again in 2013. The latest Yom Kippur can occur relative to the Gregorian dates is on October 14, as happened in 1967 and will happen again in 2043. (Wiki) As such, for example, the country with the highest Jewish population (USA) can not possibly have a non-special federal election on Yom Kippur, as regular federal elections are always held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, which is usually also the first Tuesday in November. The earliest possible date is November 2 and the latest possible date is November 8 (src). An example of the country where this could happen is UK. In 2008, Haringey Council (Alexandra ward) announced the elections for Yom Kippur. In response, Conservative Party candidate David Douglas says he was \"appalled\" by the North London authority's decision and has written to Justice Minister Jack Straw to ask for a change in the law. Christmas Day, Good Friday and weekends are already listed as dies non - days on which an election cannot be scheduled. Mr Douglas said Yom Kippur and other religious holidays should be added to the list to \"prevent this sort of farce happening again\". source I wasn't able to find any mentions of Yom Kippur elections aside from that, at least in the first five pages of Google search"

940,What level of autonomy do regions within the Russian Federation have?,NEGATIVE,"So, in the United States, of course, there is the 10th Amendment to the constitution, stating that powers not enumerated as adhering to the federal government are reserved either to the states or to the people. In practice, this means there are several powers (education, welfare, and transportation come to mind) that really are the province of sovereign states. Even if federal laws supercede state ones in many instances, states still have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court if their sovereignty has been impugned. In the days of the USSR, individual republics had, I am at least led to believe, a similiar level of authority. Boris Yeltsin, for example, rose to prominence precisely because he was able to secure Russia's rights over against the disintegrating USSR. The question then is about the current Russian Federation. To what extent are the constituent members sovereign entities? For example - could Chechnya or other autonomous Oblasts nullify a federal power? Is there an entity to which the regions can appeal a federal power? Or, are the constituent regions more akin to the Dillion Rule which states that counties are mere administrative divisions of the state? In other words, what does federalism look like in the Russian Federation?"
941,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but if you care about soveregnity, it's been conclusively resolved by Russian Constitutional Court in 2000 (src): Конституция Российской Федерации не допускает какого-либо иного носителя суверенитета и источника власти, помимо многонационального народа России, и, следовательно, не предполагает какого-либо иного государственного суверенитета, помимо суверенитета Российской Федерации. Суверенитет Российской Федерации, в силу Конституции Российской Федерации, исключает существование двух уровней суверенных властей, находящихся в единой системе государственной власти, которые обладали бы верховенством и независимостью, то есть не допускает суверенитета ни республик, ни иных субъектов Российской Федерации. I won't bother with complete translation, TL;DR rough version is The only source of power in RF is multi-ethnic People(s) of Russia, and Constitution has no basis for any state sovereignty aside from that of Russian Federation; which totally excludes any '2-level' sovereign power\" The only appeals of federal power would be Constitutional Court. As an aside - Russian Federation only has ONE \"Autonomous Oblast\" - Jewish AO (define irony - by now, due in part to extensive emigration by Jews, it has &lt;1% population who are Jewish :) All the other feeration subjects you are thinking of are \"Republics\", although some of them (not Chechnya) were AOs during USSR."
942,"",NEGATIVE,"The last round of presidential elections in Russia was held on March 4th, 2012 and December 4th, 2011 for the Duma. Elections in Russia are governed by the terms in the Russian Constitution and by legislation called the Basic Guarantees of Electoral Rights. Presidential elections are further controlled by the PEL, or Presidential Election Law. Russian election law is quite unstable and changes regularly (indeed, Duma election law is changed and amended almost every single year). However, the current law stems from Constitutional changes enacted in 2005 which extended the terms of both the Duma and President from four years each to five years and six years respectively. The Federation Council which is the unelected, 166 member upper house of the Russian legislative body officially has the authority to call Presidential elections. As such, one cannot say with certainty when the next round of elections for President will be held, but they are expected to be in 2018 at the end of Putin's 6 year term. They could in theory happen earlier though if the council so decided. Regardless of when elections are called, they will occur on the second Sunday of the month chosen by the Federation Council. Elections for the Duma will next occur in 2016 at the end of the current term. Duma elections traditionally happen on the first Sunday of December. Regional elections were recently approved to be held each year on the Second Sunday in September, except for years when Duma elections occur. In these years (once each 5 years) the elections will occur on the first Sunday of December along with Duma elections."

945,"",NEGATIVE,"I think the best way address your question(s) is by using a legal analysis. This makes sense because the pro-gay marriage position is that in denying gays the right to marry, state governments are denying them equal protection of law. This is why gays argue that laws limiting marriage to heterosexual couples are unconstitutional. In some states, the state supreme courts, interpreting the states' constitutions have accepted this argument. In these situations, the state legislatures cannot ban gay marriage without amending the state constitution. The question of whether state laws that do not allow gay marriage are unconstitutional under the US Constitution has not been decided, but the US Supreme Court will probably deal with this question during the current term in the case involving the Federal Defense of Marriage Act. As a matter of constitutional law, when a law disadvantages a particular group of people, the courts must determine whether there is a legitimate state purpose for the law. This balancing of the state interest versus individual interests is done somewhat differently depending on the group of people involved. If the group is a \"suspect class\" such as a racial group, then the state must meet a higher standard than in other cases. At this point, neither gays nor siblings are a suspect class, so the standard to show a legitimate state purpose is not as high as it would be in, say, a case involving a law banning inter-racial marriage. There is the possibility that the Supreme Court could decide that Gays are a suspect class or close to it (as the court has with women), but I think that's unlikely given the conservatism of the current court. There is little question that state governments do have legitimate interests in preventing incestuous marriages, which is why these laws have stood. In addition to the likely health problems of any children born of the union, there is also the very real possibility of coercion, particularly in father-daughter and older brother-younger sister unions. Clearly, these reasons do not apply in the case of gay marriages. So any argument equating the two classes of marriages is not convincing. As for slippery slope arguments, one of the first things one learns in law school is that while these might sound good in a debate (or on a TV talk show), they are meaningless. In reality, the law stops slides down slippery slopes all the time, because a legal system won't work if people do not draw lines. For example, it is illegal to steal things from people, but that does not mean that once we pass a law against robbery, we give every thief the maximum punishment. Stealing an apple is not the same as stealing an iPod or stealing a car or carrying out an armed robbery of a bank. These are all on the same slope, but we have been able to decide how far down the hill they are."
946,What prevents the U.S Congress from adopting a capital budget?,NEGATIVE,"Most American states are required, by law, to balance their budgets. As a result, they do - to a large extent. The United States federal government, however, does not, and has not for many years. One primary difference, however, between the States and the Federal Government is the method by which a \"balanced\" budget is declared. For states, there are typically two budgets - the first is an operating budget which only includes those items which are recurring in nature. The second - a capital budget - is for large capital investment costs that are intended to be amortized over many years. For capital expenditures such as bridges, roads, etc..., typically financed by bonds, there is no need to balance this budget. Now, grant you, many of the largest expenses of the Federal Government (entitlements, salaries for defense and administration, servicing the debt) are not part of the Capital Budgetary Outlay. As such, this alone would not necessarily \"balance\" the budget - but it would make the numbers look a lot better. So, why hasn't Congress adopted this technique yet? Considering the sheer number of budget tricks that regularly do get used, there must be some good reason not to adopt this one. What are they?"
947,Does the US Policy allowing targeted assassination of Americans suspected of being terrorists violate the Constitution?,NEGATIVE,"According to a report by NBC News: A confidential Justice Department memo concludes that the U.S. government can order the killing of American citizens if they are believed to be “senior operational leaders” of al-Qaida or “an associated force” -- even if there is no intelligence indicating they are engaged in an active plot to attack the U.S. This would seem to violate the constitutional prohibition against the violation of the due process rights of the targeted individuals. Seeing as these citizens are not members of military, and are not necessarily involved in operations against the US, it would seem to preclude the military exemptions authorized in a time of war. This policy and the actions taken in its name seem to be nothing short of state sanctioned murder. Is there any authority granted to the Executive branch of the government to take these actions?"
948,"",NEGATIVE,"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution says: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Joining the ICC would require that privileges and immunities enjoyed by citizens of the United States and its military be denied. So if the treaty was ratified it would violate the 14th amendment of the constitution. In addition Article III of the Constitution states: The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office. The ICCT would take due process and the ultimate oversight of said process and transfer it to the ICC. In order to join the ICC The US would need to either amend the existing constitution or enact a new government that allowed it. The former Secretary of State Henry Kissenger had this to say about the international courts when he was summoned to answer for the 1973 Chile Coup where the US government may have had some involvement. In less than a decade, an unprecedented movement has emerged to submit international politics to judicial procedures. It has spread with extraordinary speed and has not been subjected to systematic debate, partly because of the intimidating passion of its advocates. To be sure, human rights violations, war crimes, genocide, and torture have so disgraced the modern age and in such a variety of places that the effort to interpose legal norms to prevent or punish such outrages does credit to its advocates. The danger lies in pushing the effort to extremes that risk substituting the tyranny of judges for that of governments; historically, the dictatorship of the virtuous has often led to inquisitions and even witch-hunts."
950,Why would a state reject federal funding for infrastructure?,NEGATIVE,"The government of Florida rejected federal funding for high-speed rail. The same is true for Ohio and Wisconsin. I can't wrap my mind around this — if someone else is paying, why reject basic infrastructure? The governor of Florida said: First, he predicted construction cost overruns would put Florida taxpayers on the hook for $3 billion. Secondly, he said, low ridership would have required state subsidies. And finally, he said, if the project was shut down, the state would have to return the $2.4 billion to Washington. These statements are contested; for example, the article goes on: A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, though, said the state wouldn't necessarily have had to pay back the money and the issue could have been negotiated if Scott had ever raised it with federal officials. As to his first two concerns, bid documents being prepared by state transportation officials would have required companies bidding on the project to cover the state's obligation, as well as any construction cost overruns and operating losses due to low ridership. Companies had indicated they were willing to accept those terms. Considering that these facts are not agreed upon, were other arguments made by critics of the funding that are not being disputed by its proponents?"
951,"In the US, are there any groups proposing unsubsidised infrastructure?",NEGATIVE,"One objection that appears to be made in the U.S. against rail travel is the reliance on government-paid subsidies. Considering that the interstate highway system costs an estimated $425 billion, and funding is partly subsidised, partly paid per use (Wikipedia): About 70 percent of the construction and maintenance costs of Interstate Highways in the United States have been paid through user fees, primarily the fuel taxes collected by the federal, state, and local governments. (...) The rest of the costs of these highways are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor vehicle and fuel taxes (93.5 percent in 2007), and it makes up about 60 percent of the contributions by the states. However, any local government contributions are overwhelmingly from sources besides user fees. Are there any significant proposals to fund to all infrastructure without government subsidies, as in fully privately funded roads? Note: although the quote above is on interstate highways, I am also interested in U.S. highways, State highways, County roads, and other roads."
952,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"Sure, that sounds like a Libertarian proposal. Free-market Roads Free-market roads is the theory that a society should have entirely privately owned roads. Free-market roads are generally advocated by anarcho-capitalist works, including Murray Rothbard's For a New Liberty, Morris and Linda Tannehill's The Market for Liberty, David D. Friedman's The Machinery of Freedom, and David T. Beito's The Voluntary City. In the United States, the majority of roads in the early 19th century were privately funded and operated. In J.P. Morgan and the Transportation Kings: The Titanic and Other Disasters, Steven H. Gittelman notes: As early as 1800, there were sixty-nine private road-building companies chartered by the states. I've the course of the next three decades, th so called private road-building movement led to the development of new roads at rates previously unheard of in America. Over $11 million was invested in turnpikes in New York, some $6.5 million in New England, and over $4.5 million in Pennsylvania. Between 1794 and 1840, 238 private New England turnpike companies built and operated about 3,750 miles of road. New York led all other states in turnpike mileage with over 4,000 as of 1821. Pennsylvania came second, reaching a peak of about 2,400 miles in 1832. New Jersey companies operated 50 miles by 1821. Between 1810 and 1845 over 400 private turnpikes were chartered and built Daniel B. Klein, Santa Clara University and John Majewski, University of California – Santa Barbara has similar figures In view of the difficult regulatory environment and apparent free-rider problem, the success of early turnpikes in raising money and improving roads was striking. The movement built new roads at rates previously unheard of in America. [...] Turnpike companies in these states raised more than $24 million by 1830, an amount equaling 6.15 percent of those states’ 1830 GDP. To put this into comparative perspective, between 1956 and 1995 all levels of government spent $330 billion (in 1996 dollars) in building the interstate highway system, a cumulative total equaling only 4.30 percent of 1996 GDP."
953,"",NEGATIVE,"As a citizen of Ohio, I had a front row seat for much of the reporting and public debate over the projects you reference in your question. Taking the governors' arguments at face value, each state was primarily concerned with the costs of sustaining and maintaining the new rail lines once they were in place. The costs you mention in the question all center around who would pay for the initial construction of the line. While there was some disagreement on the facts there as you highlighted, the federal government never intended to pay long term support costs for the new trains and this was a financial commitment the governors in these states were not willing to accept. If it was truly, \"free money\" as your question suggests, the record indicates that even these governors would have accepted the money: Both Mr. Walker and John Kasich, the governor-elect of Ohio, had sought permission to spend the money on highway construction or other infrastructure projects. But the money was part of $8 billion in the stimulus bill for train projects. Instead, their concern was limited to the nature of the spending."
954,"",NEGATIVE,"Russian Federal Law is actually quite specific on this one and not as arbitrary as argued. For the Duma the president announces the elections for the \"first Sunday of the month, in which the previous legislative term ends\" (\"Federal Law on the Elections of State Duma Deputies\" of 22 April 2005, chapter 1, article 6, http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=133801) For Presidential elections the Federation Council announces the elections for the \"second Sunday of the month, in which the last presidential elections were held and in which six years ago the President of the Russian Federation was elected\" (\"Federal Law on Elections of the President of the Russian Federation\" 10 Jan 2003, chapter 1, article 5, http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=133802;div=LAW;dst=100004) As for the presidential elections in 2012, this is however not consistent with the actual dates, as the second Sunday of the month should have been the 11th March. Apparently the 11 was a working day though and that's why the elections were held on the first Sunday, i.e. 4 March 2012."
955,"",NEGATIVE,"About a hundred years ago, our nation was engaged in World War I, and needed to simplify how the government funded its responsibilities. For the Treasury to be able to fund debts incurred from obligations already legislated by Congress without additional votes from Congress every time money was to be released, the debt ceiling was created. The government website describes the debt ceiling best: “Indeed, the debt limit does not authorize new spending commitments; it simply allows the government to finance existing legal obligations that Congresses and presidents of both parties have approved in the past.” (http://www.treasury.gov/)"
956,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"Amendment V No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. Therefore, it is Constitutional only if the person in question is involved with or directly against the military, and only if we are in a time of war. Also, the Constitution doesn't say Whatever the SCOTUS says is law It just says that we trust its judgement on the Constitution when a particular issue is in dispute."
957,(Why) are policies aimed at sustainability often associated with progressive/left-wing politics?,NEGATIVE,"It appears sustainable policies are often associated with progressive or left-wing politics. For example, the Wikipedia article on green politics states: Green politics is a political ideology that aims to create an ecologically sustainable society rooted in environmentalism, social liberalism, and grassroots democracy. Opposition to pipelines such as Nord Stream in Europe and Keystone in North America also appears to be linked with progessive policies. Is this so? Why are policies aimed at sustainability divisive at all?"
958,"",NEGATIVE,"There are 3 related basis for this: Usually, proponents of 'green' stuff are only interested in government-mandated/enforced/driven solutions to the problems. This 'Big Government' approach is considered progressive, of course. A lot of 'green' movement has a political component - more specifically, anti-capitalist one. IOW, they don't see pollution/non-sustainability as bad intrinsically. They see it as proof of badness of free market/capitalism. Note: If you don't believe that, reflect that socialist countries - which have a significantly worse environmental record and worse pollution - rarely merit the 'environmentalist' interest on nearly the same level. Also witness Greenpeace protesting NATO/US nuclear weapons (but not Soviet). Example: Belem declaration, quoting as its preambule from Morales: “The world is suffering from a fever due to climate change, and the disease is the capitalist development model.” — Evo Morales, president of Bolivia, September 2007 If you need a refresher on Soviet ecology, a good primer is 'Ecocide in the USSR' by Murray Feshbach and Alfred Friendly, Jr. Or this article: 'Why Socialism Causes Pollution' by Thomas DiLorenzo The solutions proposed by environmentalists almost invariably involve taking the money (via taxes) from 'the rich' and spending it by the government, in a centrally planned way. Also a progressive associated philosophy. Quoting Brundtland Commission: Social Equality The Social Equality pillar of sustainable development focuses on the social well-being of people. The growing gap between incomes of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle- or lower-class households. Global inequality has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest 1% of the world’s population owning 40% of the world’s wealth and the poorest 50% owning around 1%. The Brundtland Commission has made an impact in helping to reduce the number of people living on less than a dollar a day to just half of what it used to be, but this can also be attributed to growth in China and India.

959,"",NEGATIVE,"The basest definition of \"conservative\" is someone who wants to keep(or conserve) things as they are, or adheres to more traditional values and more traditional ways of thinking the word \"liberal\" no longer seems to have very much to do with it's base root word of libertas which means freedom, but It does continue to be a foil for conservative. as such, the word progressive is probably more appropriate, as progressives are interested in progress or change. the difference between progressive and conservative is a fundamental trait of human nature. Do you want to change things so they become better? or do you want to avoid change so they don't become worse? Introducing more green energy is a change(or at the very least, fairly new), so it's only natural that it would be seen as progressive.

960,What policies for ecological sustainability have been proposed by conservative or economically libertarian political groups?,NEGATIVE,"This question explores the nature of the green movement, which is often associated with progressive or left-wing politics. One answer points out that it's not the problem identification that is associated with progressive politics, but rather the policies proposed to solve the problem: for example, Pigovian taxes are by their very nature a government-introduced measure that groups or people favouring small governments may frown upon. What policies for ecological sustainability have been proposed by groups that favour small governments, such as conservative, or economically libertarian groups? I am particularly interested in policies proposed by major groups that have held power in the real world, not so much in policies proposed by small (libertarian) groups that have never held office. One point I have heard from the more radical libertarian side is that if everything (including oceans and the sky) is private property, then people are liable to pay for the pollution (damage) they do to others' property. However, this does not appear to be a mainstream point of view and does not appear to be adhered by major groups that hold political office, so it is not really an answer to my question. (Edit: I explicitly mean ecological sustainability; concepts such as financial sustainability or social sustainability are interesting as well, but distinct from the present question)"
962,List of appointed offices in the US at the state level,NEGATIVE,"Where can I find a list of political offices in the US, held at the state level, that are appointed rather than elected?"
963,"",NEGATIVE,"It would probably vary wildly by state. I did find this list for Texas. The State Controllers Office notes that the govenor will appoint about 3,000 positions. In California, they have a list of Appointed State Officials that have salaries set by statute, but I couldn't find a complete listing."
964,"",NEGATIVE,"As I pointed out in a comment, free-market environmentalism is supported by the US Libertarian Party and the UK Libertarian party. So there is one proposal that has some backing from libertarian groups. Unfortunately I am not aware of any specific proposals being pushed by conservatives parties, so instead, I'll point out a few ideas from conservative and libertarian thinkers that will hopefully shed some light on what sorts of proposals we might expect from these groups. I am going to try to refrain from extrapolating too much and let the ideas speak for themselves. First, there are some who would argue that democratic, free-market capitalism in and of itself promotes sustainability and that without it sustainability is impossible. So, if you accept this premise, then the best policy that can be pushed to promote sustainability would be free-market capitalism. Second, I quote from Thomas Sowell's Basic Economics: While there are many decisions that can be made more efficiently through the marketplace than by government, this [pollution in particular, but generalizes to sustainability practices] is one of those decisions that can be made more efficiently by government than by the marketplace. Clean air laws can reduce harmful emissions by legislation and regulations. Clean water laws and laws against disposing of toxic wastes where they will harm people can likewise force decisions to be made in ways that take into account the external costs that would otherwise be ignored by those transacting in the marketplace. Third, Milton Friedman. Finally, I want to point out something about the question as written that I think relates to this discussion and might offer some insight into conservative and libertarian policies. The question deals with \"solutions\", \"One answer points out that it's not the problem identification that is associated with progressive politics, but rather the proposed solutions\" and \"What solutions have been proposed by conservative, neoconservative or...\" Some conservatives and libertarians would argue that there are no solutions to this problem, only trade-offs. For example, Thomas Sowell in The Vision of the Anointed: Moreover, the available resources are always inadequate to fulfill all the desires of all the people. Thus there are no “solutions”... only trade-offs that still leave many unfulfilled and much unhappiness in the world. Whether specifically stated or not, I think (no citations here, unfortunately) that many conservatives/libertarians share this belief. Therefore, we can expect conservative/libertarian proposals to attempt to balance these trade-offs incrementally. As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes put it to improve conditions of life and the race is the main thing--but how the devil can I tell whether I am not pulling it down more in some other place?\""
965,"If a president does extra-constitutional things, what can be done?",NEGATIVE,"Over the past decade or so, there has been a lot of noise regarding the Executive branch doing extra-legal things. Between the Bush-era Torture scandal, and the Obama-era drone strikes, it increasingly seems as though our leaders are not held accountable to the law. Some have traced this trend of leaders being above the law to Ford's pardon of Nixon. My question is: What legal mechanisms exist to prevent our leaders from violating the law? and how effective are these mechanisms?"
966,"",NEGATIVE,"First, the President is a citizen of the United States, and just like any other citizen is bound by its laws. As such, the commission of a crime is punishable under the appropriate judicial jurisdiction, as would be the case for any other citizen. With respect to extra-constitutional uses of powers of the office, our balance of powers gives recourse to the Legislative branch through the impeachment process. As defined in the Constitution: The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. What constitutes \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" has some room for debate, but as Gerald Ford once said, it can be defined as: whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history. Articles of Impeachment are drawn up by the House of Representatives and require just a simple majority to pass. At this point, the Senate must vote to convict the Impeached individual and remove them from office. This requires a two-thirds majority of the Senate. Examples of activity leading to Articles of Impeachment have included illegal activity, abuses of power, or simply activities unbecoming of the office. Effectiveness depends a great deal on the observer and the degree to which they feel extra-constitutional activity continues to occur. In the history of the Union only 19 federal officers have been Impeached (not necessarily convicted or removed from office), however, whether that is an indication that the vast majority of federal office holders abide by the Constitution or that Congress tends to overlook such cases is up for debate."
967,Where is the process for Presidential Impeachment codified?,NEGATIVE,"The US Constitution Article 2 Section for states: The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. How ever there are no rules for how the impeachment will proceed in that section. The process is set out somewhere. Where do these rules originate? What would it take to change them."
968,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"Since this is a power of Congress, you need to be looking in Article I, rather than Article II. (That said, I would have thought it was about the President, too :)) The relevant pieces of the document are: The House has the power to bring articles of Impeachment (i.e. start the proceedings) The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. The Senate actually conducts the trial, and must vote guilty by at least a two thirds margin. Article I, Section 4 The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. Beyond these rules which are set in stone by the Constitution, anything else would be subject the rules of the House and the rules of the Senate - basically the rules that are the parliamentary procedures of each body. Reference to committees, for example, falls within these rules. These rules are adopted at the beginning of each session, and define both the makeup and purpose of each committee. Committees (and any rules associated with them) are just a thing to make the body function better - if the body agreed to suspend the rules, for example, each body could set up any procedure it wanted, subject to the Constitutional limitations proscribed above. To cite a silly example, if the Senate decided that the impeached President had to attend the proceedings whilest wearing a pink tutu, the Supreme Court could not intervene on these grounds. (Cruel and unusual punishment perhaps, but the point is that within each Chamber, each body can do whatever it wants). Historically, the house has brought articles of impeachment against the President twice. Andrew Johnson was impeached, but the Senate failed to convict by 1 vote. Bill Clinton was impeached, but the Senate failed even to muster a majority. It should also be noted that the House was about to bring articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon, but Nixon resigned first."
969,"",NEGATIVE,"The law is not intended to actively prevent people from committing crimes but rather to provide a method of prosecution and punishment for those who do violate the law. This acts as a deterrent for those who would violate the law. But if the people responsible for investigating, and prosecuting violations lack the will or desire to enforce the law the deterrent factor is basically nonexistent. It is possible that the officeholders could be prosecuted criminally. However the people who would do this ultimately report up to the president. This creates a conflict of interest. Not to mention the President has the ability to pardon himself while in office. Once out of office the specter of Soviet era purges of previous administration officials is often used as a deterrent for those who would pursue criminal charges post presidency. There was discussion of criminal charges against Nixon after he resigned but Gerald Ford pardoned him preempting the criminal investigation. Keeping all of that in mind, the framers of the constitution were aware of the dangers or corruption in government. For that reason made sure that certain freedoms were protected. The freedom of press and speech to report on and speak out against illegal actions by our government. The requirement of due process to prevent the government from rounding up those who would speak out against them on dubious charges. And ultimately, the right to keep and bear arms. The idea being that if the government can not be reigned in through the law the people have a mechanism through which they can rise up and topple that government."
970,Is the Senate required to pursue a trial if presented with articles of impeachment?,NEGATIVE,"The current make up of the congress could potentially lead to a situation where the House was able to draft, and pass articles of impeachment against the sitting president. However, the Senate is currently composed of members that are not likely to support action against the current president. If that happened, could they simply be ignored by Senate leadership? If that happened would the articles expire at or before the end of the current Congress, or would those articles still be awaiting action when the next congress is instilled in 2015? Or can the the Senate call a simple take some action by simple majority to quash the articles? So my question is: If the House were to pass articles of impeachment, is there any law that would require that the articles actually be addressed by the Senate?"
972,"",NEGATIVE,"After passing articles of impeachment the House of Representatives' role is not done. During the trial in the Senate the House collectively becomes 'managers' of the trial and act as the plaintiff in a more traditional trial setting. After voting on the articles they are introduced in the Senate by the House of Representatives, not a Senator. This means that the Senate does not have control over the timeline for the original motion. In fact, they don't even get to control when the House presents the articles to the Senate (that is controlled by the Secretary of the Senate and happens automatically). From Senate Impeachment Rules: I. Whensoever the Senate shall receive notice from the House of Representatives that managers are appointed on their part to conduct an impeachment against any person, and are directed to carry articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate shall immediately inform the House of Representatives that the Senate is ready to receive the managers for the purpose of exhibiting such articles of impeachment agreeably to said notice. II. When the managers of an impeachment shall be introduced at the bar of the Senate, and shall signify that they are ready to exhibit articles of impeachment against any person, the presiding officer of the Senate shall direct the Sergeant-at-arms to make proclamation, who shall, after making proclamation, repeat the following words, viz: 'All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against ;' after which the articles shall be exhibited, and then the presiding officer of the Senate shall inform the managers that the Senate will take proper order on the subject of the impeachment, of which due notice shall be given to the House of Representatives. III. Upon such articles being presented to the Senate, the Senate shall, at 1 o'clock afternoon of the day (Sunday excepted) following such presentation, or sooner if so ordered by the Senate, proceed to the consideration of such articles, and shall continue in session from day to day, (Sundays excepted) after the trial shall commence, (unless otherwise ordered by the Senate,) until final judgment shall be rendered, and so much longer as may, in its judgment, be needful. Before proceeding to the consideration of the articles of impeachment, the presiding officer shall administer the oath hereafter provided to the members of the Senate then present, and to the other members of the Senate as they shall appear, whose duty it shall be to take the same. Once the motion is made in the Senate, the Chief Justice is automatically called upon and sworn in as the presiding officer of the impeachment trial. During the trial of Andrew Johnson articles were passed on February 29th in the House, introduced on March 4th in the Senate and the Chief Justice was sworn in March 5th. To give you an idea of the power wielded by the Chief Justice in such cases, Chief Justice Rehnquist was famously strict during President Clinton's impeachment trial, not even allowing Senators to leave the floor for the entire length of the trial once it began (to the frustration of many Senators). So the trial would proceed in a timely manner once the House passed articles of impeachment. The articles of impeachment do not expire. '[T]he articles of impeachment against Judge Alcee Hastings were presented in the Senate during the second session of the 100th Congress [...] but were still pending trial by the Senate in the 101st Congress, when the House reappointed managers [...]. The articles of impeachment against President Clinton were presented to the Senate after the Senate had adjourned sine die for the 105th Congress, and the Senate conducted the trial in the 106th Congress.' Impeachment Procedures Sec. 5 . Effect of Adjournment An impeachment may proceed only when Congress is in session. 3 Hinds Sec. Sec. 2006, 2462. However, an impeachment proceeding does not expire with adjournment. An impeachment proceeding begun in the House in one Congress may be resumed in the next Congress. 3 Hinds Sec. 2321; 111-1, Jan. 13, 2009, p __. An official impeached by the House in one Congress may be tried by the Senate in the next Congress. Manual Sec. 620; 3 Hinds Sec. Sec. 2319, 2320. Although impeachment proceedings may continue from one Congress to the next, the authority of the managers appointed by the House expires at the end of a Congress; and managers must be reappointed when a new Congress convenes. Manual Sec. 620. Managers on the part of the House are reappointed by resolution. Manual Sec. 604; Deschler Ch 14 Sec. 4.2. Thus, the articles of impeachment against Judge Alcee Hastings were presented in the Senate during the second session of the 100th Congress (100-2, Aug. 3, 1988, p 20223) but were still pending trial by the Senate in the 101st Congress, when the House reappointed managers (101-1, Jan. 3, 1989, p 84).

It is the primary conservative position that(not listed in any order): there is no need for policies to promote sustainability. that the problems envisioned by the \"Green\" movement are either imagined, exaggerated, or the result of natural forces out of our control. that given time science will catch up and deal with the any problems we are creating today. The prime example of this is for example the infamous \"Peak Horse Manure\" problem in NYC over a hundred years ago. There was too much horse manure due to horse population explosion. People were predicting that the city will drown in it. The solution to the problem arose not out of \"environmentalist\" policy to stop horse manure pollution, but out of Henry Ford, etc... innovations which replaced horses with cars. That when the technology has matured to the point that it can compete with out policies that promote its use, there will be no need for the government to create the policies. And until it is near that point the government should not be involved in picking the winner. In other words, Solar Power is a wonderful idea. Government paying for (or enforcing use of) solar power, on the other hand, is a bad idea, precisely because such actions are a sign that Solar Power isn't a good technology yet. the sustainability policies would have major adverse consequences that aren't currently being discussed, and which could be worse than the problem being addressed. The typical example is forest fire prevention policies, which long term, as we found out, cause super-forest-fires."
974,"What policy does the party \"True Finns\" (Perussuomalaiset) propose w.r.t. wolves?",NEGATIVE,"In the Nordic countries, the situation of predators in nature is often a hotly debated issue. Green parties, and other parties with a strongly urban voter-base, often hold the point of view that predators are part of nature and that a healthy population should be allowed to exist. Parties with a strong rural voter-base often propose a strong policy of hunting predators such as wolves, arguing that their existance makes life for people in rural areas difficult or impossible. In The Netherlands (not a nordic country), the nationalist conservative party is critical of hunting, whereas the Swedish nationalist conservative party supports a strong reduction in the number of wolves, via hunting. The parties are of different nature and perhaps their respective points of view are rather motivated by populism rather than a particular ideology. What is the point of view of the Finnish nationalist conservative political party True Finns (Finnish: Perussuomalaiset, Swedish: Sannfinländarna) with regard to hunting and the presence of predators in nature?"
975,Are any hunt sabotage groups active in the Nordic countries?,VERY_NEGATIVE,"Hunt sabotage, as defined by Wikipedia, is the direct action that animal rights or animal welfare activists undertake to interfere with hunting activity.. One example is the Dutch group Groenfront, which has recently done various interventionist actions to sabotage hunting. Wikipedia documents the Hunt Saboteurs Association, supposedly worldwide but does not appear to be active outside the UK, Ireland, and the United States, if they're active even there. Hunting, particularly predator hunting, has been a hotly debated topic in the Nordic countries, with radical statements being made on both sides. Considering this background, I wonder: are there any notable recent incidents of hunt sabotage in the Nordic countries, or groups propagating to carry out such?"
976,"Do \"closed cities\" exist outside the former Soviet Union?",NEGATIVE,"A closed city is a city to which foreign residents and perhaps even domestic residents cannot travel freely. Wikipedia has an informative article on closed cities. The list of closed cities today contains cities in Russia and Kazakhstan, as well as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA in the United States, but I am unable to confirm the information from Wikipedia as the Oak Ridge website opens with a quite welcoming message, whereas the town of Ostrovnoy, Murmansk Oblast, Russia clearly states on its website (google translate to English that it's ЗАТО г. Островной, i.e. a closed area. Do closed cities, defined as cities with travel restrictions for foreign or domestic travellers, exist in countries that are not former Soviet states?"
978,"",NEGATIVE,"One reason is the fiscal aspect of sustainability and renewable energies. Fiscal conservatives believe that there should be little to no government intervention in the economy, and renewable energy currently requires a large amount of government subsidies to be competitive. A push for environmentalism also requires greater government control and regulation. Taxes on power plants for the amount of CO2 they emit, the Clean Air Act, and any regulation from the EPA are evidence of that. Conservatism generally points towards a smaller government with less government control, and so this idea goes against the conservative idea. Another reason relates more closely to the idea of global warming, which leads some of the pushes for \"green\" technologies such as wind or solar. Conservative think tanks and since the 1990s have opposed the concept of global warming; they challenged scientific evidence, publicised what they perceived as beneficial aspects of global warming, and stated their strong beliefs that proposed remedies would do more harm than good. [1] For as to why liberalism has had a greater tendency to support increased environmental regulations: Environmentalism appealed to the well-educated middle class, but aroused fears among lumbermen, farmers, ranchers, blue collar workers, automobile companies and oil companies whose economic interests were threatened by new regulations.

979,"",NEGATIVE,"It would be disadvantageous to the United States to join the International Criminal Court, and they have no obligation to. The ICC would be able to prosecute US citizens for crimes, just as it would be able to prosecute other citizens, and that would limit what the US would be able to do. What the ICC can prosecute for: War crimes Genocide Crimes against humanity Crimes of aggression While it is up for debate whether the United States has committed any of these actions, if a country accused the United States of performing one of these actions, there would be a large legal battle which could end up in people being charged with crimes. Issues such as drone strikes would come under scrutiny, and while the United States claims that those are legal under international law, not everybody does. Additionally, as DVK talked about, a lot of countries have anti-United States sentiments. This could lead to the US being tied up in a great number of legal battles that could ultimately hurt the US."
982,"What is the truthfullness of the film \"Revolution.com - USA: The Conquest of the East\"?",NEGATIVE,"This is a Russian version of a French film from mid-2000s \"Revolution.com\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3QxDgft148 French version with Spanish subtitles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqPQGVBBYlc It shows how US government and government-sponsored NGOs organize \"color revolutions\" in several countries. Large part of the film (which does not deal with Russia proper) has been shown on Russian state TV. The film shows quite rare and unexpected footage which shows things I would not expect from a non-staged film. The film shows US and pro-US politicians and activists to openly explain their technique at overthrowing the governments and subverting the army. One US expat in Kyrgyzstan openly admits that it was his work to overthrow the government. The organizers of the color revolutions in different countries are shown to attend the same seminars organized by US special services. One episode shows a blackboard with a list of countries where revolutions are planned, with dates. The film shows quite surprising footage when the color-revolutionary activists from different countries discuss financial matters, divide funds and their spendings, admit loyalty to the United States. In some frames the leader of the Georgian revolution evidently appears under drugs. I do not know how it became possible to compel somebody to discuss money or appear intoxicated under camera. Still the frames do not seem to be made covertly. The film shows some events strikingly in-time, not post-factum. For example, It shows the details and mechanics of Kyrgyz revololution in motion, days before it and just after, and preparation to the Ukraininian revolution just two months before it happened, as if the creators of the film knew exactly the time when the revolution is to come, which suggests some prolonged (for years) coordination with perpetrators. It also shows some politicians in quite surprising situation, for example it shows McCain to abuse the Kyrgyz foreign minister by telephone just before the revolution and shows that minister just after the conversation saying that Kyrgyz people were not ready for democracy. It also shows Georgian president Saakashvili after his speech asking the US intelligence officer whether he said all correct, and an American expat who became a Georgian education minister after the revolution, admitting how much they spent for the revolution to come. In no frame the perpetrators make any objections to the shooting despite being shown unpleasantly and harshly accused by the narrator (for example McCain is directly accused in intervening in internal affairs of Kyrgyzstan for the cited call). Given all the above I wonder how it became possible to make all those people not only agree for an interview but expose themselves in unpleasant situations to a group that is harshly critical of their actions, show them in the course of their real work, before, after and in the process and explain their covert intentions. I also wonder why I nowhere could find not only an English version but also any reference to this film in English. Given all the above I would ask Whether this film is staged and if yes, to what degree? Whether it is a hoax? Whether it is somehow fabricated? Why it is quite unknown? UPDATE Some of the context 15:30 Mike Stone from US state-funded organization Freedom House, 10 days before the revolution, shows a typography where they print 6 anti-government newspapers and a book on how to make revolutions \"From Dictatorship to the Democracy\" (which includes the technique on how to subvert the army). A plaque on the wall indicates \"United States Bureau of Democracy\". All the equipment shows the labeled that it is property of US government, namely, the mentioned United States Bureau of Democracy. Mike Stone says that he calls the revolutions \"green\" because of money they are paid with. 22:05 McCaine talks with the Kyrgyz minister by telephone, demanding they lift ban on the cited book on how to make the revolutions, and the minister promises to do so. 25:30 After the revolution, activist of Kyrgyz revolution admits the help of the USA 25:58 Mike Stone says overthrow of regimes is his work 28:40 Bob Helvi from Einstein Foundation who also publishes the book tells some advices from the book on how to subvert the army 53:40 Seminar on how to make revolutions, Ukraine, 2 months before the revolution, organized by McCane and Freedom House 32:40 - summer camp in Crimea, organized by Freedom House and seminar there. 35:28 new Miniter of education of Georgia, at the same time, Soros foundation representative. He says Soros foundation spent $300000 for the revolution. 39:00 Meeting between Georgian and Belorussian revolutionaires (Bakeria and Lybedko). Belorussian activist says the USA senate will give them several million dollars. A representative of an unnamed US organization (possibly, Soros foundation) says they will give them 4 million for taking the power. 40:08 Bruce Jackson, US intelligence officer in retire, who heads the \"Foundation for Transitional Democracies\" oversees a speech of Georgian president. The president asks him whether he said all correct. 43:00 Belorussian revolutionary leader Lybedko discusses money in McCaine's International Republican Institute. In this place there is t-shirt with a list of planned revolutions. 45:00 Bruce Jackson's headquarters in Washington. He meets with Georgian revolutionary leader Bakeria (who became advisor of Georgian president after revolution), and with two Russian anti-Putin activists who say they came to learn how to make revolutions. The narrator cites Bruce Jackson to say Russia is the next target for the revolution."
983,"",NEGATIVE,"For example - could Chechnya or other autonomous Oblasts nullify a federal power? Neither it can, nor Soviet republics could, nor a US state can as I understand this question. Is there an entity to which the regions can appeal a federal power? Yes there is, they can appeal to a court. You should note though that since 2004 the heads of the regions of the Russian Federation are not elected, but appointed by the president (this is outdated, the heads are elected again). As such it is unlikely any region would try to appeal the federal actions supported by the president. Yet the appeal to a court could be done by the elected regional parliament, the prosecutor's office, by individual parliament member or any other body whose interests are involved. The court to which they would have to appeal depends on what act they want to appeal. In most cases of the presumably illegal actions of the ministries or federal agencies or in the case of contradictions inside the law they can appeal to a local court of the lowest level, which can then be escalated up to the supreme court in case of disagreements."
984,"",NEGATIVE,"If you are interested in the question about personal dictatorship, arguably there was no personal dictatorship in the USSR after Stalin dead. But the communist revolutionaries themselves described their state as \"dictatorship of proletariat\" which they considered the highest form of democracy. They also considered the Western bourgeois democracies to be dictatorships of the bourgeoisie. The USSR officially remained dictatorship of proletariat (Preamble of the Constitution of 1924 and Article 2 of the constitution of 1936) until 1977. In the constitution of 1977 it was declared that the state was not dictatorship of proletariat any more because there was no bourgeoisie remaining and became the state of the whole people. So the USSR was not self-declared dictatorship after 1977."
986,"",NEGATIVE,"I think this question has more complexity than just the ratio of government and private businesses. That is one side. Other side is social development of the country. If we consider this, we can say one country is more socialistic than an another. On the top of that we shouldn't mix the communist ideology with socialist. Ideal socialist countries should be where: a. where social benefits are widely available and highly supported by local or governmental authorities. b. where more basic functions of a society are state owned (education, energy, public health etc...) c. where labor unions are strong and independent from higher control, they are directly empowered by workers. d. where the rights of people are flat, and divided equally in the society So let's see examples: Communist states (North Korea, China, Soviet union): a. true (but non functional), b. true, c. false (it is very dependent on government), d. false Scandinavian model (Norway, Sweden): a. true, b. true, c. true, d. true I know these for sure, other countries need further research for me."
987,Why does Kaliningrad belong to Russia?,NEGATIVE,"Kaliningrad: former name is Königsberg. I always wondered about why and how Russia kept Kaliningrad (located between Poland and Lithuania on the seaside). I see the strategic point of the city, it can hold some flotilla, and also I see its population mainly now is Russian. But how it comes that the territory was never questioned, since Russia (more precisely USSR) gained this territory by the second world war. Does anybody have a clue why it never joined to the neighbouring countries or to Germany? Just because Russian population?"
988,"",NEGATIVE,"As stated in the question, Prussian Konigsberg was in fact depopulated by the Russians after WWII, and annexed. This was part of the terms of surrender, as the region around Gdansk in particular, had long been sore point. (The Gdansk corridor, in particular, was given to Poland after WWI as part of the terms of surrender too.) Desiring an additional warm water port on the Baltic, Russia chose to place a naval base there. As the remaining Baltics had by then been incorporated into the USSR there was never any questioned opposition by, say, Lithuania. Poland had already been greatly enhanced by the addition of Pomerania and Silesia. As such, territoriality, there were no other claimants."
990,"",NEGATIVE,"Additional notice to the debt to GDP ratio: this ratio is showing nothing if we don't see through the whole picture. Let's assume that country A is in debt, and the gdp-debt ratio is 100%, and their central bank gives 6% on bonds. Take then country B which has 200% debt to the gdp, but their central bank gives 1% on bonds. Of course this will be a serious simplification, but it will be easy to see the point. Country A pays 6% of it's annual income to keep the debt ratio. Country B pays 2% of annual income to keep up the level. It is easy to say in this simple system that Country A is in worse situation than Country B. What is the catch? If the loan interests are changing, for example if the credit of the country changes, and the lenders don't trust in country B, a smaller amount of percentage raise effects double than country A. Effects of high debt: There are two major cases of debts: own currency debt and foreign currency debt. This second one is way worse. If a country can't pay their debts, they have a choice to devaluate it's currency and cause artificial inflation to handle the debt level. Whoever owns that country's debt gets the short end, they receive the partial money they lended to the country. In case if a country has the debt in foreign currency, that means that country can't operate with devaluation tool. The only working way in this case to simply refuse to pay. That is called bankrupcy. Both cases can lead to hyperinflation."
991,"",NEGATIVE,"Sadly I am sure I can't give a whole answer, but maybe it can be improved later. Main reasons - reason chains - why nationalism being enforced in Europe. First of all, as in the 30's: economic tension. When the standard of living get stucked at a certain level, and recession starts, people tend to feel that the problem is based on the current system, and they are more likely to listen to those who are telling some radically different. Radical parties in booming periods are usually below 5% since no radical change needed, everything seems fine. As soon as something extraordinary happens in world economy, and their own economy, they seek quick solution, and those parties standing up with alternatives. This happens with left-wing radicals as well, but I am sure it is not popular because of the \"recent\" collapse of USSR and eastern-block. Second big factor is the European Union itself. It restricts the right of a nation in exchange of the common good. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes not. As a huge system, EU isn't flawless. For example Hungary had to close all but one sugar factories because of EU regulations and quotas. If somebody wants to criticize the EU, they can, and some things should be changed. If you make a political platform based on contra-EU politics, you can get a decent voting base. Third factor is oppositions' privilige: populism. You can say whatever you want when you are not in power, you don't have the pressure to make everything plausible what you are saying, since you don't have to deal with everyday economic problems like a governing power. Of course when a populist party or platform gets the power, they have to come back to reality. This happened in Hungary. After the populist right-wing won the elections, they had to continue to press out as much money as they could from the people. Like the previous government did. Now their popularity declined from 55% to 20%. So populism helps them to grab the power, but depends on them if they can really provide alternative. And their biggest enemy is winning an election. Since that is the time when they have to decide what to do: go back to reality and risk popularity, or remain populist and risk a bankrupcy. I hope this answer helps find the final answer."
994,"Why is the phrase \"civil rights\" used with such a narrow meaning in the USA?",NEGATIVE,"When the president name-checked the watershed moments of the women’s rights, civil rights and LGBT equality movements, he offered a powerful moment of official recognition. Melissa Harris-Perry, The Nation. Of course, women's rights and LGBT rights are civil rights, but Melissa Harris-Perry here uses the term civil rights to refer to racial equality only. That, in fact, seems to be the standard usage of the term in the USA, but not elsewhere. Why is that?"
996,Do any diversity immigrant visas exist outside the USA?,NEGATIVE,"In the United States, diversity immigrant visas, also known as the Green Card Lottery or DV Lottery, are visas awarded on a lottery program, primarily to countries with low immigration rates to the US. Is this system unique in the world, or are there any countries with similar systems?"
997,"",NEGATIVE,"While Civil Rights in the USA means far more than racial equality only, it is common to use the term synonomously with racial equality because that was the driving force behind the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Thus, because of the name of the law, over time that has become another term for racial equality. Even though that act prevented discrimination based on people's religion and gender also, it is still most highly associated with racial rights. Even with that sort of explained, it is quite common in US politics for groups to hijack words/phrases for their political benefit even if the hijacker has little corresponding relationship to the original meaning of the word. e.g. Progressives, has little to do with progress, but it sounds better than liberal :) So looking for a logical reason why phrases mean what they do can just be chalked up to colloquialisms."

For example, do all of them favour the biggest party?"
1002,"For the average American, what would the consequences be if the USA defaulted on the national debt?",NEGATIVE,"First off, we know that currently the USA owes about $16.5 trillion. Of that though, nearly $5 trillion is intergovernmental holdings. That debt would not directly affect the average American, because it is just a promise to payback another government entity for borrowing from it. That leaves about $11.5 trillion that the American taxpayer is still on the hook for paying, unless they choose to default. Does it make better financial sense to default on this loan, or to pay it back with interest over the next (century?)? Since I know it will be mentioned, from my understanding the Full Faith and Credit clause doesn't secure the national debt with any real property. Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof. The power behind the FFaC clause is that it, can promise repayment of debt securities they issue because they can raise money through taxes. The question is, if the US defaulted, what would be the effect, not on the federal government, but on the ordinary citizen living in such a country? In other words, what is the downside of doing this, not from the perspective of the government, but to regular people?"
1003,Does any present legislation practice exile as a regular sentence?,NEGATIVE,"In antiquity, courts could sentence a person convicted of a crime into exile. For example, in ancient Athens, According to the preserved part of the inscription, unintentional homicides receive a sentence of exile, while intentional murders are punishable by death. Today, article nine of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. The Wikipedia article on exile describes the practice of former heads of state being exiled to far-off countries, but this is rather a politically motivated move in an attempt to build stability than a punishment decided in a court of law. Do any contemporary legislations have the power to impose exile by a court order, such as to sentence a person convicted to exile? I think there are court orders than a person can no longer be close to another person, their home, their workplace or perhaps their children's school, but what about exile as in being forced to leave the home city, region or country completely?"
1004,Is democratic centralism limited to Leninism?,NEGATIVE,"Wikipedia describes democratic centralism as follows: The democratic aspect of this organizational method describes the freedom of members of the political party to discuss and debate matters of policy and direction, but once the decision of the party is made by majority vote, all members are expected to uphold that decision. This latter aspect represents the centralism. As Lenin described it, democratic centralism consisted of \"freedom of discussion, unity of action.\" When defined as such, is this limited to Leninism? As a principle, I see no fundamental reason why it cannot be applied by groups with very different political convictions. Is democratic centralism limited to Leninism, or are there any significant examples of wholly different groups applying \"freedom of discussion, unity of action\"? P.S. I am not after a discussion about the Leninist system in theory vs. the Leninist system in practice."

As I expected, they seem neutral-positive towards the Polish people depending on the type of news, they suspect the Jews behind international agreements against neo-nazism. They have an fairly antisemitic attitude. But, for example, they cheered a letter from Młodzież Wszechpolska. So their sympathy is more to the right wing radicals than to the Polish people. They really have Turanian ideas, but their main target to blame are the Jewish population of the world and mostly the Israel state. They don't like the Slovak, the Romanian and the Serbian nationalism, these feelings being backed by the loss of the territory in 1920. Check the Trianon Treaty for further information. They try to build up a strong relationship with the Arabic world. They also have a strong feeling to help similar ideas in countries they do like, including Poland. Hopefully, I hope this partially answers your question."
1007,"",NEGATIVE,"Professor Burkhauser has done extensive research on who is hurt by higher minimum wages. For example, Burkhauser et al. (2000) show that minimum wage increases reduce employment among most vulnerable groups. In addition, Sabia and Burkhauser (2008) state: Our results show that recent minimum wage increases between 2003 and 2007 had no effect on state poverty rates. Moreover, the proposal to raise the Federal minimum wage to $9.50 per hour is unlikely to be any better at reducing poverty because (i) most workers (89.0 percent) who are affected are not poor, (ii) many poor workers (48.9 percent) already earn hourly wages greater than $9.50 per hour, and (iii) the minimum wage increase is likely to cause adverse employment effects for the working poor. You might also find Burkhauser and Finegan (1993) informative."
1008,"",NEGATIVE,"This question has already been widely discussed and answered on Skeptics. For information I will copy the most upvoted and accepted answer, courtesy of Borror0, here: The answer to this question is \"we're not sure yet.\" The \"old minimum wage research\" shows that there is a negative impact, but more recent research - e.g. Card and Kreuger (1993) and Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010) - show that there is no significant effect. There have been attempts at reconciliation the literature on the subject, but, to the best of my knowledge, nothing resembling a consensus has been achieved amongst economists. When reviewing the possibility to raise the minimum wage again, Québec's Interdepartmental Committee for the Review of the Minimum Wage compiled a short review of the literature. It's written in language most people will understand, and only six pages long. It's definitively worth reading. In the event you don't feel like reading it, the most interesting passage is the following: Economic debate concerning the minimum wage has essentially been focussed around two subjects of discussion. These are the impacts that such a policy has on employment levels and its effects on the distribution of wealth. Economic theory generally approaches the impacts that the minimum wage may have on employment using mainly two models. These are a “pure and perfect” competition model (or neoclassical) and an imperfect model called “monopsony”. Over the last 40 years, economic studies based on the neoclassical model show that mainly young people less than 24 years old are generally the most affected by job reductions that are likely to take place when the minimum wage increases. Elasticity calculated by these models varies between –0.1 and –0.3, meaning that a 10% increase in the actual minimum wage will generate a reduction of employment for young people varying between 1% and 3%. An econometric made by the Department of Finance leads to a similar conclusion for young people aged between 15 and 19. However, numerous conditions must be met for this model to apply, and because of that, many economists have challenged its relevancy, especially since the nineties. These economists prefer the use of a monopsony model that includes market imperfections. Results obtained using this model are very different from those obtained with the neoclassical model. In fact, they lead to the conclusion that the increases in the minimum wage that occurred over the last 15 years in certain areas of North America and Europe did not hinder employment."
1009,"",NEGATIVE,"There's no unanimous consensus in the research, but whatever consensus there is, is that minimum wage does not HELP reduce poverty, and can increase it. One good study is from National Bureau of Economic Research, http://www.nber.org/papers/w6127, Neumark, David and William Wascher. 'Do Minimum Wages Fight Poverty?,' Economic Inquiry, 2002, v40(3,Jul), 315-333. The results show that over a one-to-two year period, minimum wages increase both the probability that poor families escape poverty and the probability that previously non-poor families fall into poverty. The estimated increase in the number of non-poor families that fall into poverty is larger than the estimated increase in the number of poor families that escape poverty, though this difference is not statistically significant. We also find that minimum wages tend to boost the incomes of poor families that remain below the poverty line. The evidence indicates that in the wake of minimum wage increases, some families gain and others lose. On net, the various tradeoffs created by minimum wage increases more closely resemble income redistribution among low-income families than income redistribution from high- to low-income families. Given these findings it is difficult to make a distributional or equity argument for minimum wages."
1010,"",NEGATIVE,"The concept of party system was introduced by English scholar James Bryce in American Commonwealth (1885). The split is based on significant changes in thinking that redefined parties that held power during those time frames: We are currently on the Fifth Party System, Republican/Democrat The First Party System of the United States featured the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party . The Second Party System saw the Jacksonian Democrats (who grew into the modern Democratic Party), and the Whig Party. The Third Party System was characterized by the emergence of the anti-slavery Republican Party. The Fourth Party System retained the same primary parties as the Third Party System, but saw major shifts in the central issues of debate. The Fifth Party System emerged with the New Deal Coalition. each system has entries in Wikipedia Note that the entry about Party System has the US entering the Sixth Party System in 1964 As with any classification when it relates to people or ideas, there is much speculation on what constitutes a party period.

The controversy is partly about the allegation that France expels people based on ethnic rather than legal criteria. Wikipedia describes both sides of the argument pretty well. My question is about another aspect. I thought that, under European Union (EU) regulations, any citizen of the EU is free to relocate within any other country in the EU. This rule is one of the reasons for political opposition to admitting new member states into the EU. From BBC News: Romanian President Traian Basescu said he understood \"the problems created by the Roma camps outside the French cities\" but he insisted on the \"right of every European citizen to move freely in the EU\". But from the same article: They have the right to enter France without a visa, but under special rules they must have work or residency permits if they wish to stay longer than three months. (...) From January 2014, or seven years after the two countries' accession, Romanians and Bulgarians will enjoy full freedom of movement anywhere in the EU. What does this full freedom of movement mean? Does it mean the freedom for EU citizens to enter any country and stay as long as they want, or can countries still impose restrictions on immigration from other EU countries, as France has done with immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria?"

There are some exceptions for people with disabilities where they receive money based on what they could have contributed, but yes you have to contribute to be eligible for SSI at retirement This seems strange to me, for at least 2 situations. I'd like clarification on whether people in those situation indeed get no Social Security benefits, or if they do, how does that square with @Chad's comment: Do elderly people who weren't around to pay FICA tax (e.g. recent legal immigrants) get Social Security benefits? What happens to someone when they were on welfare all their life, or made too little income to have paid FICA tax otherwise? Do they get no Social Security benefits?"

(hat tip: Sean Cheshire's answer) However, it looks like these rules were violated in 2011/2012. As per Wikipedia: During 2011 and 2012, for example, FICA tax revenue was insufficient to maintain Social Security's solvency without transfers from general revenues. These transfers added to the general budget deficit like general program spending. How was the legality of such a move resolved when this seemingly violated 42 USC § 401?"
1017,"",NEGATIVE,"Wikipedia briefly justifies it as: Union Territories of India have special rights and status due to their constitutional formation and development. They may be given this constitutional status for reasons such as safeguarding the rights of indigenous cultures of that region, averting political turmoil related to matters of administration and so on. These union territories could be changed to states in the coming times to exercise better control in their administration. Yet that text, only partly answers the question. Here is a reference which is a first hand description of the reasons and proceedings. In the above citation SHRI SRIBALLAV PANIGRAHI explains: There have been references to the provisions of the Constitution dealing with the Union Territory, statehood etc. When we achieved Independence, we had nine regular States. At that time, the States were coming under four categories. These were Part 'A', Part 'B' and Part 'C' States. They were also called `A' class, 'B' class and 'C' class States. In Part 'A', the States were nine in number. In Part 'B', we had Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Bharat, Mysore, Patiala and East Punjab. In Part 'C', we had five States, namely, Ajmer, Bhopal, Bilaspur, Kooch Bihar and Coorg. In Part 'D', only one Territory, namely, Andaman and Nicobar Islands found its place. There was a provision kept for future and if need be and if we acquire a new territory in course of time, then that would join Andaman and Nicobar Islands in Part `D' category. There was a dramatic change in this arrangement in course of time. As you know, there were demands from different areas for separate States. There was also a Boundary Commission, the States Reorganisation Commission. I think the Commission was constituted under the Chairmanship of Fazal Ali. P.M. Panicker was one of the three Members of the Committee. They were brilliant and seasoned people with experience in different areas. Their recommendations were accepted and States were reorganised. And the old arrangement disappeared and under the new arrangement, States and Union Territories were formed."
1018,"",NEGATIVE,"The right of Union citizens (and their families) to move and reside freely within the Member States that originated with the Schengen Agreement in 1985 is regulated by Directive 2004/28/EC of the European Parliament and Of the Council (emphasis mine): (9) Union citizens should have the right of residence in the host Member State for a period not exceeding three months without being subject to any conditions or any formalities other than the requirement to hold a valid identity card or passport, without prejudice to a more favourable treatment applicable to job-seekers as recognised by the case-law of the Court of Justice. (10) Persons exercising their right of residence should not, however, become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State during an initial period of residence. Therefore, the right of residence for Union citizens and their family members for periods in excess of three months should be subject to conditions. (12) For periods of residence of longer than three months, Member States should have the possibility to require Union citizens to register with the competent authorities in the place of residence, attested by a registration certificate issued to that effect. While the freedom to move exists, it's not unrestricted and the aforementioned articles are the legal basis for France's expulsion of the Bulgarian &amp; Romanian Roma populations. The Directive also allows Member States to place additional restrictions, even within the first three months of residence: (21) However, it should be left to the host Member State to decide whether it will grant social assistance during the first three months of residence, or for a longer period in the case of job-seekers, to Union citizens other than those who are workers or self-employed persons or who retain that status or their family members, or maintenance assistance for studies, including vocational training, prior to acquisition of the right of permanent residence, to these same persons. (22) The Treaty allows restrictions to be placed on the right of free movement and residence on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. In order to ensure a tighter definition of the circumstances and procedural safeguards subject to which Union citizens and their family members may be denied leave to enter or may be expelled, this Directive should replace Council Directive 64/221/EEC of 25 February 1964 on the coordination of special measures concerning the movement and residence of foreign nationals, which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.

1019,"Repaying high debt in a country, without get ruined, is it possible? Example?",NEGATIVE,"In another question it was asked what it means to a country if it has a high debt. I'd like to know whether there are there examples of a country paying back high (100%+ Debt to GDP ratio) debt? I remember that Romania under Ceaușescu paid back their debts (of 13 billion dollars). I have no info on GDP that time (late 70's), but Romania was practically devastated by 1989 when he was ousted and killed. The shops were empty, exports were the only working part of the economy, and it was impossible to get anything from abroad. Is there any healthy example where a country could pay back their debts? Of course without having very serious problems. Further: If so: does that way work in all cases? Is it better than just going bankrupt? If not: is there any point in paying back a single coin for a country which has serious debt issues?"
1020,"",NEGATIVE,"Several examples exist of countries paying back large debts - but perhaps the best recent example is that of Latvia. During the economic downturn in 2008, Latvia was constrained by its currency peg to the Euro to pay off its debts at full value (meaning not by simply devaluing its currency). As a result, it took a hit of nearly 18% to its GDP - that's nearly a crippling 1/5 of its economy, gone. It undertook this hit willingly, in the hopes of joining the Euro and the EU. Come 1/1/14, it is scheduled to do so. Typically, large debts are paid by devaluing the currency. While this has the short term effect of driving off investors, in the long run, it is the least \"bad\" way to do it. This Planet Money podcast explains the legal travails that Argentina faced when it chose to default on its debt, and also argues why Greece doesn't really have an Argentinian option. That said, the actual devaluation is widely credited with getting Argentina back on track. Brazil had a similiar experience."
1022,"",NEGATIVE,"No you can not: SOURCE Everyone born in 1929 or later needs 40 Social Security credits to be eligible for retirement benefits. You can earn up to four credits per year, so you will need to work at least 10 years to become eligible for retirement benefits. During your working years, earnings covered by Social Security are posted to your Social Security record and you earn credits based on those earnings. Each year the amount of earnings needed for a credit rises as average earnings levels rise. In 2010, you receive one credit for each $1,120 of earnings, up to the maximum of four credits per year. You will need to work for at least 10 years to collect Social Security. And qualified earnings are those earning where you paid social security employment tax. Any income that is not subject to SSI Tax (like capitol gains) is not qualified earnings. If you become disabled there is a schedule linked on the source page that explains the requirements to collect the Social Security Disability benefits. Totalization agreements are an exception. If a worker has a total of 10 years between their home country and the US then they can qualify for a partial payment of Social Security benefits. With respect to Mexico if a worker has at least 6 credits in the US and can show that they have a combined total of 40 quarters of contributions to the US and Mexican Social Security systems, then the worker can draw a prorated benefit payment from both systems.

1023,"",NEGATIVE,"This is the text of SEC. 12601.

Congress has for the last several decades used excess funds(read funds that were not needed to meet obligations of the SSA) to pay for spending. Now that the money they have borrowed from the SS Trust is needed congress needs to return the borrowed funds to the trust. This law makes provisions to do that. There is no requirement that any law be justified legally before being passed. It is worth noting that the President vetoed 2419 but that the veto was overridden by congress in 2007. In order for the law to be invalidated it would need to be challenged in court."
1024,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"tl;dr It depends upon what you mean by 'didn't pay I to the system.' The non-partisan Government Accountibility Office (GAO) has released several reports, and there seems to be a wide range ($0 to as few as 18 months) of how much you have to pay into FICA to begin collecting Social Security checks. As a government employee, you might pay as little as $0. In the GAO 2010 report, SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Management Oversight Needed to Ensure Accurate Treatment of State and Local Government Employees noted: At present, SSA and IRS managers do not know the extent to which wages are reported accurately or to which Social Security taxes are paid in accordance with program rules State and federal officials found that, over decades, [...] in hundreds of districts, [...] some teachers were incorrectly paying Social Security taxes when they were not eligible to receive Social Security coverage. Others were not paying Social Security taxes although they were covered by Social Security. Since IRS did not collect any back taxes from audited school districts, SSA and IRS officials told us that the U.S. Treasury and Social Security Trust Funds would effectively bear the cost of any long-standing coverage errors and FICA taxes that school districts and employees did not pay. You might argue that those we're clerical errors, and shouldn't count, just because the mistakes occurred to long ago for the IRS to correct the error. There are other cases of government employees working only a single day, paying as little as $3 in FICA and collecting thousands in annual social security checks, fully following the law. In 2004, Congress closed the loophole with legislation requiring public employees be employed for five years in a job covered by Social Security in order to be eligible for full spousal benefits. The GAO report, SOCIAL SECURITY Congress Should Consider Revising the Government Pension Offset 'Loophole' notes: Social Security’s Government Pension Offset (GPO) exemption [...] prevents workers from receiving a full Social Security spousal benefit on top of a pension earned from government employment not covered by Social Security. However, the law provides an exemption from the GPO if an individual’s last day of state/local government employment is in a position that is covered by both Social Security and their state/local pension system. In these cases, the GPO will not apply, and Social Security spousal benefits will not be reduced&gt; In 2002, one-fourth (or 3,521) of all Texas public education retirees took advantage of this exemption. In most schools, teachers typically worked a single day [...] the Social Security contributions deducted from their pay would total about $3 for the day. We estimate that the average annual spousal benefit resulting from these last-day transfers would be about $5,200. So, before 2004 you could work as little a one day, and your spouse would be entitled to full spousal benefits. After 2004, as a government employee you only need to work five years instead of the typical ten years. Illegal aliens are also entiltled to Social Security benefits, even if they weren't working in the U.S. legally at the time. In fact, the Totalizaion agreement with Mexico encourages them to do so, because they are entilted to benefits from working as few as 18 months, to as much as 9.75 years, even under a stolen identity. The 2003 GAO report SOCIAL SECURITY - Proposed Totalization Agreement with Mexico Presents Unique Challenges notes: SSA provided no information showing that it assessed the reliability of Mexican earnings data and the internal controls used to ensure the integrity of information that SSA will rely on to pay social security benefits. Mexican workers [...] could qualify for partial social security benefits with as few as 6 coverage credits. In addition, under the proposed agreement, more family members of covered Mexican workers would become newly entitled Under the Social Security Act, all earnings from covered employment in the United States count towards earning social security benefits, regardless of the lawful presence of the worker, his or her citizenship status, or country of residence."
1025,Are there some patterns as to which judges in US are elected and which are appointed?,NEGATIVE,"It looks like some judges in the US (seems mostly on local level) are elected, whereas some (e.g. SCOTUS) are appointed. Is there a good, well-known pattern (based on judge level, locale, etc...) that would explain which judges are appointed vs. elected? It could be an actual law governing this, or merely a descriptive function/pattern that fits all the existing data."
1026,Is there a difference between Sheriff and regular county level police officers in USA?,NEGATIVE,"Wikipedia has this to say about Sheriffs (of United States, not Nottingham :) In the United States of America, the scope of a sheriff varies across states and counties. The sheriff is always a county official, and serves as the arm of the county court. The sheriff always performs court duties such as administering the county jail, providing courtroom security and prisoner transport, serving warrants, and serving process. In urban areas a sheriff may be restricted to those duties. Many other sheriffs and their deputies may serve as the principal police force. As such, is there any difference between a Sheriff and any other officer in charge of county police (the above quote seems to imply the reporting difference, e.g. one would report to the court and one to the county administration)? Or is the difference merely in whether the post was called \"Sheriff\" historically in a given locale but with no functional distinction?"
1028,"",NEGATIVE,"The normal difference is that Sheriff is usually an elected position. As the highest law enforcement officer in the county, the Sheriff either has subordinates report to him (Deputy Sheriff) or is a higher authority than other law enforcement. In the United States, a sheriff is generally, but not always, the highest law enforcement officer of a county. A sheriff is in most cases elected by the population of the county. The sheriff is always a county official and may serve as the arm of the county court (but these may be called marshals). The scope of a sheriff varies across states and counties. Although, this varies from county to county. Missouri has a county that eliminated the position of elected sheriff in 1955; the St. Louis County Police Department has an appointed police chief that performs the duties of the sheriff. Colorado has two counties that have appointed sheriffs rather than elected officials like the other 62 counties. Denver and Broomfield are city-and-county entities, which are required to have and/or perform a sheriff function. Denver's \"sheriff\" is the manager of safety, who is appointed by the mayor to oversee the fire, police and sheriff departments and is the ex officio sheriff."
1029,"",NEGATIVE,"A good example of what you are looking for is from the City &amp; County of San Francisco. They have both a Sheriff's Department - led by a democratically elected Sheriff overseeing a department of over 850 uniformed deputies and civil staff members and a Police Department led by the Mayoral appointed Chief of Police. According to the SFSD Wikipedia page the Sheriff's Department has 4 internal divisions that cover some of the duties you mention in your question but others as well: Administrative &amp; Program Division (training, in-jail job training and education, Prisoner legal services, community programs, etc.) Custody Division (Overseeing the county jails, security of county run hospitals - SF General &amp; Laguna Honda, I.D. Processing, etc.) Field Support &amp; Services Division (Providing Security for City &amp; County Admin Buildings and Officers, Investigation Unit, K-9 unit, emergency response and special response team, etc.) Management Division (Sheriff's department administration, financial department, public information, etc) On the other hand, there is San Francisco Police Department - led by the Chief of Police. The SFPD serves as the main law enforcement arm of San Francisco and maintains many other specific functions (see their Wikipedia page for more detail) So you can see, though SFPD and SFSD both function in the same jurisdiction and are subject to the same large budgetary process, their functions and purviews are quite different."
1030,Do children that attend Head Start preschool programs perform significantly better than those who don't?,NEGATIVE,"During the 2013 State of the Union Address, Barack Obama said Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road. But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Most middle-class parents can’t afford a few hundred bucks a week for private preschool. And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives. Obama never defined what he meant by learning or high-quality preschool, but he used this statement to propose a new federal pre-K program for low and moderate income Americans. Education advocates expect the program to resemble a proposal in an article and report called Investing in Our Children which states Finally, our fourth objective is to increase enrollment in Early Head Start, a program that has proven to be extremely effective. Therefore, in addition to the policies laid out above, we also propose to double enrollment in Early Head Start, which currently enrolls 120,000 children at an average annual cost of $12,000 per child. Doubling Early Head Start would cost an additional $1.44 billion per year and $11.5 billion over 10 years. Is Head Start effective at improving the performance of children? Does this performance increase (if any) have a lasting effect (\"for the rest of their lives\"), or does it fade after several years?"
1031,"",NEGATIVE,"TL;DR: There was a very minor effect lasting past first grade (vocabulary), but overall, by 1st and especially 3rd grade there was virtually no effect. So no, there was no lasting effect. This is based on a multi-year study/set of studies done on behalf of U.S. US Department of Health &amp; Human Services/ Administration for Children &amp; Families Head Start Impact Study: Final Report, Executive Summary - January 15, 2010 There were no impacts for 4-year-olds in the cognitive domain at the end of kindergarten. At the end of 1st grade, there is suggestive evidence of a positive impact of access to Head Start on PPVT (vocabulary) scores. [DVK's note: specifically, their impact was detailed to be p=0.09]. The average 2003 PPVT score for a child in the 4-year-old control group was at the 27th percentile among children in the general population. Head Start group children’s scores were four percentile points higher, at the 31st percentile. For the 3-year-olds, average 2003 PPVT scores were at the 29th percentile for the control group and the 32nd percentile for the Head Start group. No significant impacts were found for math skills, pre-writing, children’s promotion, or teacher report of children’s school accomplishments or abilities in any year. Similar results from Third Grade Follow-up to the Head Start Impact Study: Final Report from 2012 (same source: U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services/ Administration for Children &amp; Families): Please note that I have excised any paragraphs pertaining to (usually positive) impacts and benefits that were DURING head start - this was done for brevity and not some nefarious attempt to bias the answer by omitting postitive-sounding bites; otherwise the full quote from the report ran for 2 pages. Looking across the full study period, from the beginning of Head Start through 3rd grade, the evidence is clear that access to Head Start improved children’s preschool outcomes across developmental domains, but had few impacts on children in kindergarten through 3rd grade. ... In contrast, there was little evidence of systematic differences in children’s elementary school experiences through 3rd grade, between children provided access to Head Start and their counterparts in the control group. In terms of children’s well-being, ... However, these early effects rapidly dissipated in elementary school, with only a single impact remaining at the end of 3rd grade for children in each age cohort. In the health domain, early favorable impacts were noted for both age cohorts, but by the end of 3rd grade, there were no remaining impacts for either age cohort. Finally, with regard to parenting practices, the impacts were concentrated in the younger cohort. In summary, there were initial positive impacts from having access to Head Start, but by the end of 3rd grade there were very few impacts found for either cohort in any of the four domains of cognitive, social-emotional, health and parenting practices. The few impacts that were found did not show a clear pattern of favorable or unfavorable impacts for children. Further, from \"Third Grade Follow-up to the Head Start Impact Study: Final Report, Executive Summary December 21, 2012\" (this seems to be pretty much the same report as the previous one, but was listed separately on HHS website): Looking across the full study period, from the beginning of Head Start through 3rd grade, the evidence is clear that access to Head Start improved children’s preschool outcomes across developmental domains, but had few impacts on children in kindergarten through 3rd grade. .... In contrast, there was little evidence of systematic differences in children’s elementary school experiences through 3rd grade, between children provided access to Head Start and their counterparts in the control group. In terms of children’s well-being, there is also clear evidence that access to Head Start had an impact on children’s language and literacy development while children were in Head Start. These effects, albeit modest in magnitude, were found for both age cohorts during their first year of admission to the Head Start program. However, these early effects rapidly dissipated in elementary school, with only a single impact remaining at the end of 3rd grade for children in each age cohort."
1033,"",NEGATIVE,"The Economist has recently had several articles talking about the efficacy of preschool programmes. From Human Capital: Mr Obama's appears to be drawing heavily on the work of James Heckman, a Nobel-laureate economist at the University of Chicago, who in turn draws heavily on two relatively small studies, one focusing on the Perry Preschool Project and the other on the Carolina Abecedarian Project. Charles Murray, a conservative sociologist, sums up the standard complaint against generalising from the results of these projects: The samples were small. Perry Preschool had just 58 children in the treatment group and 65 in the control group, while Abecedarian had 57 children in the treatment group and 54 in the control group. In both cases the people who ran the program were also deeply involved in collecting and coding the evaluation data, and they were passionate advocates of early childhood intervention. These shortcomings do not automatically disqualify the results, but think of it this way: if the case against the efficacy of early childhood interventions rested on two studies with small samples conducted by people who were openly hostile to such interventions, no one would pay any attention to them. I think Mr Murray's right. So then what? Katherine Mangu Ward of Reason writes: If only we had some kind of large scale well-tracked pilot program that could give us some information about whether that is a good idea. Oh wait! We do! It's called Head Start, the $8 billion federal program catering to more than 1 million low-income kids.Better still, the federal government has done a huge study, tracking 5,000 kids and comparing them to kids who did not have access to Head Start.The findings are not impressive. A 2010 analysis of that group found that the cognitive, health, parenting, and social benefits of the program had vanished by first grade. And a 2012 look at the third grade outcomes was even less heartening, with no discernible academic gains and teachers reporting slightly more behavioral problems in the Head Start kids. This is basically the state of the debate over subsidised pre-school for families who can't otherwise afford it. If you favour the idea, you cite Mr Heckman on the Perry and Abecedarian results; if you oppose it, you cite the lacklustre performance of Head Start. From Learning for the very young, there is the sense that it could be good, but nailing it down is hard: The most recent report by the OECD, a rich-world think-tank, in 2009, found that 15-year-olds who had attended pre-schools for more than a year performed better (even accounting for socioeconomic background) than those who had attended for only a year or not at all. In Belgium, France and Israel pupils educated at pre-schools had much higher reading scores than those who had stayed at home. Yet establishing the precise link between time in pre-school and later achievement is difficult. .... Yet the key to success, if any, is unclear. Measuring other data, a report on pre-school availability and teaching standards called “Starting Well” (compiled for the Lien Foundation by the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company) placed Finland top (it scored direly in the OECD study). At least 98% of children aged five or six are in pre-school education there. Finland also dominates the overall league tables for education performance, so perhaps the scope for improvement is slight. Other enthusiastic providers of pre-school education like Sweden, Norway, France and Belgium and Denmark do not score particularly highly on attainment in later education, whereas Japan, which combines early-years provision with a fiercely competitive exam culture, excels. So too does South Korea, where the state until now has provided under half of pre-school places. So pre-school is no panacea, says Andreas Schleicher, who oversees the OECD’s big triennial PISA report on educational attainment. “Drilling children” in early years does not lead automatically to learning gains, he says. Finally, in Social Mobility in America, they argue the chief effect is to help overcome socio-economic barriers. In arguing against an entrenched meritocracy (which essentially just becomes a new aristocratic class), The Economist suggests that early opportunities help select the best children early on, so that resources can flow to them."

1039,"",NEGATIVE,"Consider the spatial voting model as a very simple mathematical model (made famous by Anthony Downs in, 'An Economic Theory of Democracy') imagine that voters care only about one topic. There is a one-dimensional variable X, and every voter has a preferred value. Given options, a voter will choose the one closer to his/her preferred value. For example, my preferred value of X is 42. So if one party offers X = 30 and the other party offers X = 50, I will vote for the latter, because 42 is closer to 50 than to 30. (There is usually an assumption that the voters' preferences are on a bell curve. However, for a model with one variable and two parties, this assumption is completely unnecessary.) The winning strategy for a political party is to offer such value of X that exactly half of voters want more, and half of voters want less. (It's called median.) Here is why: Imagine that we have 100 voters, each of them wanting a different integer value from 1 to 100. My party offers 50. The opposing party offers 30. What happens? I will get the half of voters that wanted values above 50, and also the voters between 40 and 50; so I obviously win. So in this model each party will try to offer the middle position, which is why both parties will offer almost the same thing. By moving closer to your opponent, you keep the voters on your side, and get a few more voters between your original positions. In the end, if voters want values from 1 to 100, one party will offer 50, the other one will offer 51, and both will get half of the votes. Add a third political party, and the game changes dramatically. There is no universally best position, because it depends on what the other parties do. In the model where voters want values from 1 to 100, if one party offers 1 and other party offers 100, you win the election by offering 50. But if one party offers 49 and other party offers 51, offering 50 would be a losing move, and your best choice is 52... but this will make the party which offered 51 make change their strategy, etc. The parties will dance around, trying to get either inside the largest gap between other parties, or to the least-extreme extreme position if other parties get far away from the extremes. There is no stable solution, because in any position at least one party would prefer to change their offer assuming that the offers of the remaining two parties remain the same. The weakness of this model is of course the original assumption. First, how much can user preferences be reduced to a one-dimensional variable? Actually, it seems they can (and the dimension is traditionally called \"extreme left - moderate left - center - moderate right - extreme right\"), although sometimes there are exception. Second, how much do votes depend on voters' priorities and parties' offers? In other words, how much rational the voters are. In my opinion, not much... they will vote even against their interests, just because e.g. the television told them to. This reduces the credibility of the model. These videos explain the median voter theorem well. Median Voter Theorem Animation Game Theory 101 MOOC (#40): Hotelling's Game and the Median Voter Theorem -- EDIT: Another weakness of this model is that it does not consider primaries, conflicts among candidates within each party. A candidate may choose a position which is better for him/her against other candidates from the same party, even if it is worse for the whole party. And if both parties have such candidate, one of them will win despite choosing a position suboptimal for his/her party. Again, an example with numbers: Voters want values from 1 to 100. It would be optimal for a Low Party to propose 50, and for a High Party to propose 51. But let's say there are two candidates for the Low Party, L1 and L2. L1 chooses 50, which is best for the party. L2 chooses 45. What happens? In closed primary, the Low Party voters want values from 1 to 50, so 47 of them (numbers 1 to 47) will vote for L2, and only three for L1 (numbers 48 to 50). Similarly, in the High Party, a candidate H1 chooses 51 and a candidate H2 chooses 60; H2 wins against H1. Finally in the election L2 with number 47 wins against H2 with number 60. Both candidates L1 and H1 lost in primaries, despite the fact that without the internal competitor L1 would win against H2, and H1 would win against L2. The lesson is, even if median positions are best for the party, they may be worst for the candidates in primaries. So probably the two-party system in itself leads to convergence of platforms, but primaries prevent too much convergence."
1040,"",NEGATIVE,"The 12th Amendment is saying that the President and Vice President need to come from different states - not that the electors cannot vote for the \"home state\" candidate. Indeed, on average, most candidates receive their home state votes, and for much of the 19th century, this regional advantage was often considered when choosing candidates. In fact, this was actually an issue in the election of 2000. While Dick Cheney had been a member of Congress from Wyoming, he was, in the year 2000, arguably a resident of Texas since he had property there. George W. Bush, governor of the same state, was as well. In order to avoid the prohibition in the 12th amendment, Cheney had to quickly change his residency back to Wyoming (and sell his property), in order to avoid a lawsuit that had been filed. Eventually, a three-judge panel ruled that Cheney was, in fact, resident in Wyoming. Had they not done so, Cheney would have been disqualified, and Bush would have had to name another person as his VP. (In actuality, he would have had to convince the electoral college to vote for another VP candidate, but I suspect that would have been formality, seeing as they were to pledged to vote for Bush.)"
1041,Has there been a sustained period of conservatism in the US?,NEGATIVE,"It seems to me the United States has generally become more liberal (by the modern American definition) over time. It has more civil rights, taxation, welfare, secularism, and government programs now than it did 50 years ago. For example, racial segregation was still legal up until 1964. Religious affiliation has decreased by 11% since the early 1970s, and those with no religious identification have become the second largest category of religious identity. And it was more liberal at that time than 50 years before that. And before that. And before that. All the way up until the founding of the country. Have there been any periods of time 20 years or longer where the US has become more conservative? (That is, \"less liberal\" as liberal is described above.) When were they? What policies were enacted? Were those policies reversed?"
1042,"",NEGATIVE,"NO. Pre-school doesn't guarantee any lasting affects on a child's life. There is no accurate or relatively accurate way to gauge a child's educational outcome based on something as small as pre-school. There are many factors that affect a student's performance. Death in the family, trouble at home/neighborhood/school, parental financial situation, social engagement with family and peers alike, whether the kid is shy, spontaneous, creative, mathematical or more of a problem solver, whether a child is naturally talented at something, even down to the child's diet just to name a few can affect/shift performance through children's lives. You would also have to consider how a lot of bright people come from some of the poorest and ill equipped countries in the world, along with their educational system and personal backgrounds. There are plenty of children who grew up being aces living in bad conditions, just like there are plenty that grew up in the best conditions, but have poor education. There are also those kids that didn't start of well in school, but went to college graduating with high grades along with those kids that excelled in school, but bombed college academically. Whether pre-school had any significant influence is too narrow and random of an area to measure 25 years. So no, not by itself."
1043,Will the Sequester result in an increase in spending over 2012?,NEGATIVE,"Several news organizations are reporting that if the Sequester is allowed to be implemented it will most likely not be felt by most Americans, and that even with the Sequester cuts 2013 spending will still be a net increase of 15 billion dollars over 2012. Is this true? If so then why would the government need to furlough anyone?"
1044,Why is North Korean Air Koryo banned from the European Union?,NEGATIVE,"Air Koryo is currently banned from the European Union with the cited reason being safety. Yet Air Koryo had its last accident with fatalities in 1983 thus being one of the safeties air companies in the world. Formerly the EU cited the outdated aircraft as the reason but after they bought two new Russian Tu-204's, the EU still refused to lift the ban. Is there anything more than safety to it? Is it because of ideology? I also found a reference to the assessment by Skytrax where the company was rated 1 star, the only such company in the world. The main reasons cited were the newspapers with state propaganda and state music as well as \"non-edible\" food. Yet to me the food visually does not differ, or is even better than, what I received on board of Transaero (is not the food prepared by the airport anyway?)."
1045,"",NEGATIVE,"As of 2010, the ban is partial and it excludes the two Tu-204's. Air Koryo can operate the two new aircraft (registration marks P-632 and P-633) normally into the European Union. For the rest of Air Koryo's fleet there are several concerns regarding safety &amp; security, summarized in EC Regulation No 474/2006: Air Koryo (10) There is verified evidence of serious safety deficiencies on the part of Air Koryo. These deficiencies have been identified by France and Germany, during ramp inspections performed under the SAFA programme (11) Persistent failure by Air Koryo to address deficiencies previously communicated by France was identified during other ramp inspections performed under the SAFA programme. (12) Substantiated and serious incident-related information communicated by France indicates latent systemic safety deficiencies on the part of Air Koryo. (13) Air Koryo demonstrated a lack of ability to address these safety deficiencies. (14) Air Koryo did not respond adequately and timely to an enquiry by the civil aviation authority of France regarding the safety aspect of its operation showing a lack of transparency or communication, as demonstrated by the absence of reply to a request by that Member State. (15) The corrective action plan presented by Air Koryo in response to France’s request was not adequate and sufficient to correct the identified serious safety deficiencies. (16) The authorities of the Democratic People Republic of Korea with responsibility for regulatory oversight of Air Koryo have not exercised an adequate oversight on this carrier in accordance with their obligations under the Chicago Convention. (17) Therefore, on the basis of the common criteria, it is assessed that Air Koryo does not meet the relevant safety standards.

1046,"",NEGATIVE,"Historically, political parties diverge. The other answer is putting forth either the The Special Law of Curvilinear Disparity which places party leaders and regular party supporters are in the middle, and ideological sub-leaders at the extremes of the party. a theory, put forward by the political scientist John D. May, which posits that the rank and file members of a political party tend to be more ideological than both the leadership of that party and its voters. Or the Median Voter Theorem. a majority rule voting system will select the outcome most preferred by the median voter. The Median Voter Theorm cannot be used to explain a possible convergence of parties to the middle, because of several limitations to the theory. Once more than a single issue is being considered, the scale becomes multidimensional. If voters are considering more than one issue simultaneously, the median voter theorem is inapplicable. This may happen if, for example, voters may vote on a referendum regarding education spending and police spending simultaneously. The Curvilinear Disparity Theorm has its own issues. Several studies have called this theory into question. A Norris Pippa study, May's Law of Curvilinear Disparity Revisited, found that the most ideological members of the parties in the 1992 British general election (Conservative, Labor, Liberal Democrat), were the most extreme. A Herbert Kitschelt study had similar findings The Internal Politics of Parties: The Law of Curvilinear Disparity Revisited when examining Belgian parties. Other studies in the USA have found similar results. (TL;DR)"
1048,Do parties support the mayor/city council candidates in a Canadian city?,NEGATIVE,"I voted in one prairie Canadian city for mayor and city council. In the country I was born, every mayor and counsellor is announced and supported by a party, which is known publicly. However, in this election I couldn't find anywhere such information: neither in their candidate profile, nor on internet. So, in Canada, are the city candidates supported by parties and if so, is this known publicly or how can one find out?"
1049,"",NEGATIVE,"According to this article: http://reason.com/blog/2013/02/19/what-will-sequestration-really-look-like the sequestration would cause 44 billion to be cut from the year 2013 budget. CBO estimates that 2013 budget would have 3.553 trillion dollars in outlays, compared to 3.538 trillion in 2012. That means that the outlays of 2013 budget are indeed projected to be 15 billion higher than 2012 budget. Note however that CBO projections are basing on current law and existing predictions of government revenues. The laws can be changed by the Congress, and the projections can be (and in the past, sometimes were) wrong. So we do not know if 2013 budget outlays would indeed be bigger than 2012 and by how much, we only know they projected to be more by 15 billion. However, it is not entirely correct to say \"sequester will result in an increase of spending\". The sequester itself will result in decrease of spending, but combined with the fact that regardless of the sequester the spending is increasing, the net result would still be increased spending, albeit less of an increase than without the sequester."
1050,"",NEGATIVE,"The answer is: it varies. For example, Canada's largest city (Toronto) runs its municipal politics on a non-partisan basis, where neither the mayor nor the councillors are formally members of parties. Other major cities such as Ottawa and Calgary do the same. That isn't to say that party politics is absent from the process, and mayors often have associations with some party or other. On the other hand Montreal mayors are typically members of political parties. The current mayor is an exception as he took office after the previous mayor resigned during a corruption investigation. (EDIT:The mayor I just mentioned has now also resigned as part of a corruption scandal. Oh Montreal.) These parties are specific to Montreal municipal politics. Vancouver also works this way (i.e. with political parties - not with multiple corruption scandals)."
1051,"What non-religious arguments, if any, are used against LGBT rights in general and marriage equality in particular?",VERY_NEGATIVE,"It appears to me that opposition to marriage equality comes primarily from religious groups, in particular from the Abrahamic religions. Quoting Wikipedia: Many forms of religions, including the Eastern faiths and Abrahamic faiths, do not support homosexual sex. Evangelical Christianity,[10] Catholicism,[11] Mormonism,[12] Orthodox Judaism,[13] and Islam,[14] hold the view that homosexual sex is a sin and that its practice and acceptance in society weakens moral standards and undermines the family. The Wikipedia article doesn't expand much on non-religious opposition to same-sex marriage. It appears most countries with strong anti-LGBT laws are countries with a dominant Muslim or Christian population (red shades on this map from Wikipedia), although attitudes within religion-dominated countries differ significantly (primarily catholic Spain has legalised gay marriage and 82% believes LGBT should be accepted, but in majority Hindu India this figure is only 10%). On the legal side: Apart from arguments originating from the (Abrahamanic) old testament, what sources exist for opposition to marriage equality?"
1052,"",NEGATIVE,"First of all, in practice, the answer is 100% yes, since there existed numerous strong examples of either atheist, or non-Abrahamic religious societies antagonistic to homosexuals. USSR was 100% atheistic. LGBT in USSR starting with Stalin was punished significantly more harshly than in the evil-anti-gay-theocracy-USA (even at the beginning of the century, before gay rights movements in US). No gay in USA was ever sent to labor camps (nor, as far as I know, been convicted to lengthy prison sentence), both of which was the norm in USSR. Both Mayans and ancient Greeks were not very positive about homosexual relations outside pederasty - e.g., penetration of an older male was NOT positively viewed. Same was true for the Norse. Same with Ancient Egypt. Aztecs were not very good to homosexuals, especially bottoms (evidence from Bernal Diaz, we don't really have much good primary sources on Mexica Empire sadly). In North Korea, marriage is only between a man and a woman, and homosexuality isn't very well thought of (though AFAIK not directly criminalized). In India, strongly religious people/authorities oppose same sex marriage (src) Jainism is a lot more liberal on LGBT attitudes, but definitely NOT what you'd call \"equality\", and the views espoused in it would get any conservative in USA labeled as \"homophobic bigot\". (src) Zoroastrianism has a negative view (src) Nazi Germany put gays in concentration camps. This may be argued to being an artifact of German Christian values, so let's call it a \"maybe\", unlike the previous ones. Zimbabwe's Mugabe explicitly claimed that original inhabitants of the country (before Abrahamic religions) didn't practice homosexuality. I won't take that as scientific evidence, but worth noting if you are careful to be skeptical. As far as non-religious arguments against \"LGBT rights\" in general (NON-marriage): A LOT of the arguments stem from the social/cultural view that a proper adult man should not be receiving sexual penetration (see the list of non-Abrahamic countries above). This is especially proven in cases where pederasty was considered proper. Some of the modern arguments in socialist dictatorships were based on the fact that homosexuality is \"western/capitalist deviancy\" (which is big news to all the Marxist/Gramscian leftist LGBT rights activists in Western countries). See North Korea, or USSR (USSR was slightly more complicated, but North Korea it's open and shut case of this attitude). Non-religious arguments against \"LGBT rights\" groups (NON-marriage-related): Please note that some of the arguments are more about \"for negative view of LGBT rights activism\" and less about \"arguments against LGBT rights\" per se. In other words, someone may oppose groups/actions of rights activists, yet outside of that opposition, personally thinks that gays and lesbians should not be discriminated against and does not discriminate against them, at least outside of marriage stuff. Some people of right/libertarian orientation in the west dislike LGBT activists specifically for their super-strong Marxist/Gramscian and statist/big-government leanings (or for some right wingers, for anti-traditionalist and anti-American views that have nothing to do with homosexuality). This is evidenced by popularity of \"Conservative Lesbian\" blog (note: she was an official blogger for CPAC'2010, sponsored by redstate.com, and a personal friend of Andrew Breitbart. Not exactly a non-entity on the right, in other words), and good opinions of GOProud. As a 2018 update, this is extremely well evidenced by extreme popularity on the right/libertarian side of openly homosexual libertarian Dave Rubin (who mentions \"his husband\" and his sexual orientation on nearly every podcast I heard), or alt-right figure Milo Yannopolis (sp?). Basically, an extremely large chunk of modern US right wing doesn't care who or what you do in the bedroom, as long as you hold political positions/views they agree with. This is especially prevalent on libertarian side, where people in general tend to have absolutely no anti-LGBT beef on \"moral\" grounds. Some arguments are based on general dislike for open and flaunted sexuality (which LGBTs tend to be reputed to have, whether accurately or not isn't very relevant). This seems to be the case around China, where many attitudes are less about \"homosexuality bad\" as in \"dial down sexual display, all'y'all\" - see Confucianism section of Wiki article about religions and homosexuality linked above. This is important since it's also a basis of dislike by some people in Western societies - I am personally aware of many people whose attitude is \"I don't care who someone has sex with, but I don't want them sticking their sexuality in my face, gay or straight\" - such people tend to view Gay Pride parades in San Francisco with just as much distaste as Mardi Gras or Rio Carnivals. Again, in this case the special LGBT dislike is more about (true or false, doesn't matter) perceived tendency by LGBT crowd - at least in the West - to flaunt their sexuality more than straights, and not to the homosexuality itself. Such people would very happily be friends/coworkers with someone who is gay in private. Please note that this one doesn't strictly speaking belong on this list at all - people holding this view tend to completely lose their interest in someone's sex orientation as far as all normal rights are concerned. They EQUALLY don't want to know that you're gay, OR that you're straight, especially around their kids. Related to the last point, some people strongly oppose to homosexuality being taught about in school to young kids. NOT because it's homosexuality, but because sexuality is being taught in the first place (I'm talking 6 year olds here). A lot of them - again may be rightly or wrongly - see that as a result of LGBT pushing. Opposition to same sex marriage, independent of child rearing. First, tons of libertarians are against ANY marriage recognition/special treatment by the state, unless it relates to child rearing. Same sex or hetero sex. Second, some people view the drive to legalize gay marriage as an assault on \"traditional\" cultural values. In other words, they are perfectly fine with same sex civil unions, but not with calling them \"marriage\", thereby redefining what \"marriage\" always meant (yes, many of them come at it from Christian religious background, but not all). Incidentally, many of them are from the same set of people who oppose LGBT activists as left wing actors. In other words, they view the drive for same sex marriage as less of \"for the equality\" and more for \"let's stick it to those right winger traditions\", and react defensively based on that perception (again, the proof is in the pudding. Many of them are a lot more receptive/less resistant to the same ideas coming out of GOProud and such). Another large factor here is simply the fact that same sex marriage was a branding topic - it simply evolved as a point of contention between conservatives and progressives, and polarized to the point where people would espouse views on the topic merely because their tribe's prevailing views were so (this is clearly evidenced by research done by social psychologists, who managed to convince people to switch LGBTQ viewpoints after in-person interviews - abstractly held political bumper sticker talking point doesn't always survive contact with real live human beings). Opposition to same sex marriage as a vehicle of child rearing. This is different than general LGBT rights. One of the arguments that are very specific to child rearing in marriage is a concern that on average, children NOT raised by a male and female parent are not being provided with a correct upbringing. (very very simplified version of one such argument would be that a girl raised by women would never learn to relate to men correctly relationship-wise; same with a boy raised without a woman. Similar concerns about a girl being raised without a woman figure in a family of 2 fathers, or a boy with only women parents - they lack a proper figure for emulation). A separate version of this argument is conservative/evolutionary-psychology type. Basically, if children being raised in a same sex couple household would NOT somehow be a long term problem, then nearly-100%-heterosexual-family-model-acceptance would not have evolved. They don't know for sure WHAT the problem may be, but they view the fact that almost every single culture on Earth didn't have same sex child rearing as proof that there is SOME problem, from evolutionary perspective. Opposition to the claim that \"marriage equality\" includes same-sex marriage. Having re-read the question, I noticed that it was phrased in a leading way that is rejected by many opponents of same-sex marriage - they specifically reject the claim that \"marriage equality\" includes same-sex marriage; and that refusal to recognize same-sex marriage constitutes \"unequal treatment\". Obviously, this is no longer a view shared by US SCOTUS, but nevertheless, a lot of people object based on this line of reasoning. The general arguments go as follows: Homosexuals are not being denied the right to marry in general. Merely the right to marry specific subset of people. They very specifically can marry anyone of opposite sex; thus have same rights heterosexuals do. The concept of restricting a set of people one can marry DOES exist in the law: you cannot marry a close relative, you cannot marry more than one person, you cannot marry someone underage, you cannot marry someone not alive/not human, etc... Therefore, US law does NOT recognize universal right to marry anyone you like. The only meaningful legal difference seems to be that homosexuals have far more political power and influence than poly-amorous people or those wishing to marry their sibling/parent. (which is where we circle back to above-mentioned libertarian notion that the state shouldn't even be in the business of recognizing or not marriages). Please note that I'm listing the arguments as they exist - whether any of them are valid or not is irrelevant to the question. If you care about its correctness, ask on Skeptics.SE :)"
1053,What percentage of the 2013 budget does the sequester cuts represent?,NEUTRAL,The sequester cuts to the growth in spending of the federal budget will result in a reduction in a increase in spending of $85 billion. What percentage of the 2013 budget does this represent?

1055,"",NEGATIVE,"Arguments against homosexuality There are four main arguments against homosexuality. Homosexuality catalyzes spread of HIV and other sexual deceases. It was cited for example as one of the main reasons why homosexualism was prohibited in the late USSR. There are two reasons why it is so Homosexual acts usually involve anal penetration, which involves more tension and the rectum skin less prone to mechanical damage. This often leads to micro abrasions through which the infection can pass. This is especially important for HIV. Heterosexual contacts employ various natural protection mechanisms which homosexual intercourse lacks. One of them is that the medium in male and female sexual organs have opposite properties: the medium in vagina is acidic while the medium in penis is alkaline. This makes it difficult for infection adapted for male organs to invade female ones and vice versa. Homosexuality leads to depopulation of the host nation and degradation of culture. This argument is often used by various nationalists, racists and racialists and also by Men's Rights movements. It was also expressed by Putin when he spoke about new Russian law against homosexual propaganda. The main idea behind this is that homosexuality is the most widespread among the segments of the population in which the instincts are the less prominent (such people are called \"low-primative\" following Protopopov and Novoselov). But at the same time, the low-primative people constitute the core of civilization, being the drivers of science and scientific progress. Homosexuality limits the spread of low-primative genes leading to the rise of the primativity of the population. Less primative ethnicieties are replaced with more primative, the intellectual elites are replaced with the social bottoms (whose activity is determined by the instincts and as such they are not involved in homosexuality). This, accompanied with other feminist innovations targeting low-primative men such as unbearable financial sanctions imposed on financially successful men for having many children, destruction of the marriage, harassment laws etc leads to the cease of reproduction of the intellectual elite, destruction of culture and eventually collapse of the nation. Homosexuality increases sexual disbalance. In any society there is excess of sexually active men on the sexual market compared to sexually active women. This has multiple causes The duration through which an average man and average woman participate in the sexual market is about twice greater for men. Men usually participate in sexual market from the age of 15 to 75. Women usually participate from 13 to 35. After bearing children or marriage many women leave sexual market while men are less likely to do so. Positive polygamy coefficient for men and negative for women. A man usually wants and strives for more than one sexual partner while women express \"crowd effect\": they usually want a man who already successful among women, so many women attach to a single sexual partner with no interest in other men. In a result, small percent of men has large percent of available women leaving the majority of men unsatisfied. This all leads to the rise of the prices which men pay for sexual services. Homosexuality worsens the situation. With equal number of gays and lesbians, the share of women available on sexual market decreases in higher proportion compared to men. This, further exemplified with other feminist measures such as the increase of age of consent, creates huge deficit of women on the sexual market and huge amounts of sexually unsatisfied men. This in turn leads to social tensions, rise of rapes and other crimes and political extremism. Homosexual propaganda may affect one's children. Some people while not objecting private homosexual acts would be strongly opposed to public expression of homosexual love, as well as any \"equal-rights\" measures, because this may agitate their children into homosexuality. This may be viewed highly undesirable because of the following reasons among others: It is evolutionary advantageous for all people to spread their genetic material as widely as possible. This is one of the reasons why people bear children and ensure their safety. If the kids are involved in homosexuality, this may stop the spread of the genes and discontinue the family. In some cultures passive homosexuality is seen as very shameful and the people are stigmatized. For instance, in Russian criminal community according their informal code of conduct \"Poneatia\" passive homosexuals are singled as untouchable. Knowing this a parent may be afraid that this may heavily complicate the life of their children not only in case they imprisoned but also in the real life."
1056,Where did all this deficit come from?,NEGATIVE,"Back in 2008, the deficit was somewhere around $200 billion, until the bank bailout, which was reported at first to be a 1-time bailout of $800 billion. The next year, there was the Stimulus package, which was reported to be around the same cost. But those 2 years passed, and the federal deficit remains above a trillion. One might expect it to drop back down to pre-bailout levels in 2010, but that hasn't happened. Why hasn't the deficit already gone back down. What's making it linger at close to the same level it was during the bailout?"
1057,What is the current impact of TARP (bank bailout) on US deficit?,NEGATIVE,"As far as I am aware, at least some of the money that was given by US Government under TARP was paid back to the government. As such, how much of the ~$800 Billion was given back to the treasury and how much was not? In other words, what is the contribution of TARP to budget deficit as of 1/1/2013? (if you wish, for extra credit you can include side amounts such as interest paid on TARP borrowing by the Feds, on one hand - and the interest the financial institutions paid to the government on the money they got from TARP on the other. I doubt that either one would have a significant effect though)."
1058,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"OK, based on Daily TARP Update for 2/1/2013 from US Treasury: | ($Billions) | Loaned | Repaid | Balance | Writeoff | Income | CashBack | =====================+========+========+=========+==========+========+==========| | Bank bailouts only | 250.46 | 234.00 | 16.46 | 3.15 | 6.65 | 268.16 | | Total TARP paid | 418.11 | 344.43 | 73.68 | 27.10 | 43.02 | 387.46 | | TARP + AIG shares | 418.11 | 344.43 | 73.68 | 27.10 | 60.58 | 405.01 | Therefore, of $418 Billion TARP, the government was directly repaid $344.43 Billion ($73.68 balance), or $387 Billion if you include interest and other non-principal payments excluding AIG shares ($30.65 Billion balance). This drops to $13.1 Billion once AIG shares held by Treasury are included. Therefore, the total DIRECT TARP contribution to 2012 YE deficit was $13.1 Billion, plus or minus pocket change of couple billion depending on if you trust governments valuation of some assets. This figure would, however, rise slightly if you remember that TARP - all $418 Billion of it - contributed to deficit and therefore had to be borrowed. Therefore, the figure should theoretically include the borrowing costs of that $418.11B, which I didn't since I don't have a good schedule of repayments. NOTE1: To clarify based on Chad's comments - I have included the 'Writeoff' column just for color, but neither the 'Balance' column (which I personally calculated simply as Loaned-Repaid), nor 'CashBack' column (which I checked to be exactly 'Repaid+Income'), include writeoffs as an asset. The only report column which included writeoffs as asset is 'Outstanding', which I didn't use at all. NOTE2: In case someone is curious WHY there was extra income, as I aluded to in the last note, recall that - on top of simple interest and fees paid by TARP recipients - some of TARP was in the form of 'Government paid for distressed assets, which were later sold off'. As one example, Maiden Lane transactions (Bear Stearns and AIG assets) netted the government profits: In a February 28, 2012 press release, the New York Fed announced that the remaining securities in ML II were sold, and will result in full repayment of the $19.5 billion loan extended by the New York Fed to ML II and generate a net gain for the benefit of the public of approximately $2.8 billion, including $580 million in accrued interest on the loan. On Thursday August 23, 2012, the Federal Reserve announced that Maiden Lane III had sold the last of its AIG portfolio that day. The Fed had earned a profit of $17.7 billion from the AIG and related assets. The bulk of all Fed profits are required by Fed rules be turned over to the U.S. Treasury. The Treasury still held a 53 percent stake in AIG's stock which it planned to gradually sell in an effort to recover the remaining $24.2 billion investment (note - the latter was part of the difference between lines 2 and 3 of my spreadsheet above)."
1059,What is the difference between EFTA and the EU?,NEGATIVE,"In Iceland, which is an EFTA country, there is currently a debate raging about possibly joining the EU (and then adopting the Euro currency). Now one of the arguments put forward by those who are against an agreement is that the country would lose parts of its sovereignty. Does anyone know the difference between being a member of EFTA and EU when it comes to legal, judicial, financial and other sovereign matters? Are EU countries less sovereign?"
1060,"",NEGATIVE,"Government spending, 2009 and on, surged (consistently and permanently above 3.5T every year, compared to 2-3T before 2008)). Revenue dropped (except for 2012) to slightly above 2T. Deficit = \"revenue-spending\", so yearly deficit obviously increased to above 1T. Source: http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/spending_chart_2002_2016USb_12s0li101lcn_G1fG2fG Please note that these figures did NOT include spending on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which would have pushed the spending as well as deficit up by ~$120-150B a year (The Pentagon's total allocation for war from 2001-2011 in current dollars was $1,208.1 based on CBO), so actual deficits would have been north of $300B yearly before 2008, not $200B, to compare apples to apples. Now, if you are curious what drove the spending increases that helped along this high deficit, let's look at the #s behind the graphs below in 9 spending categories - although, the graphs should give a very good idea even without the tables. But here's the data, hopefully self explaining. Most of the increase (NOT diminished at all) vs. 2008 was Welfare spending, followed by Seniors , then Defense, followed by Other (which was mostly high in 2009, likely due to TARP). P.S. On a side note, as I figured out here, despite the $800B figure for TARP, in reality it was just over $400B, and all but $17-18B of it was paid back to the Treasury by 2013."
1061,What differences exist between the platforms of the Socialistische Partij and the Partij voor de Dieren?,NEGATIVE,"In The Netherlands, the Socialistische Partij is a socialist party, founded in 1974, entered parliament in 1994, and presently one of the 4th largest party in parliament and the 3rd largest by members. The Partij voor de Dieren is a small party that has been represented in parliament since 2006, on an animal rights and animal welfare platform. I have the impression that for all issues not directly related to animal rights and animal welfare, the Partij voor de Dieren agrees with the Socialistische Partij. And even for animal rights issues, quite often the Socialistische Partij and the Partij voor de Dieren agree. Is this impression accurate? From parliamentary voting records, what are the most significant platform differences between the two parties, if any? Of course, there are differences in style, focus, strategy, etc., but my question is limited to actual parliamentary voting records."
1062,Why is the Reformed Political Party Youth the largest political youth organisation in The Netherlands?,NEGATIVE,"In The Netherlands, the Reformed Political Party Youth (Dutch: Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij-jongeren) is the largest political youth organisation, with 12000 members. They are allied to the Reformed Political Party (Dutch: Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij (SGP)), a theocratic organisation with roots in the bevindelijk gereformeerden, an orthodox protestant church. Elements in the platform of the SGP include that the government should be based on the word of God, the Belgic Confession, that \"false religion\" should be actively averted by the government, and that women cannot be part of government (Note: this is a selection of some of the more unusual elements from their platform, which includes many more traditionally conservative points seen in platforms of other conservative parties and less orthodox christian-based parties in The Netherlands and other countries). This party always has had 2 or 3 seats out of the 150 in total (proportional representation), but the membership has gradually increased from 10000 in 1945, 20000 in 1980, to almost 30000 in 2013. At the same time, religion overall is in decline. Why is it that a theocratic party that is relatively small in politics has such a gradual increase in membership in a society that is getting less religious? And why is their youth wing the single largest political youth organisation in the country?"
1063,Reasoning & Benefits Behind the USSR Assisting China's Nuclear Program,NEGATIVE,"What motivated the USSR to assist China with the development of Nuclear Weapons? Ie, How did this benefit the USSR? Why would the USSR want China to have this technology during the 1950s and early 1960s? What did they get out of this transfer of technology? What could possibly be the strategic and political reasoning behind providing such strategic technology to a neighbour country. The reasons I can think of are that China was one of the most prominent Communist countries and the USSR had an interest in seeing that Communism succeeded and spread, therefore having a nuclear China could assure its longevity(avoid foreign attacks and occupation) and maybe assist internal/domestic stability? Also maybe China having nuclear weapons would cause friction with the West and drive China towards the USSR, to avoid China being an adversary by giving them a common enemy(the west)."
1064,"",NEGATIVE,"I found this link on the subject: http://www.sinodefence.com/strategic/organisation/programme.asp I read from other sources (sorry, I don't remember them now) as well that USSR primary target was nuclear power. In the beginning China was strong ally for USSR, and in the 60's their diplomatic relationship became cooler. So for the 50's USSR assisted them as an ally to enforce the communist block and of course increase their own power by an ally. After Stalin's death under Khruschev this relation decayed slowly, and became hostile for sure during the Sino-Soviet border conflict. I am guessing the soviets' primary target as the nuclear power generation was the main goal, and they didn't really mind if the chinese people make bomb as well. But as I know it wasn't a goal. The propaganda was about peaceful use of nuclear power."
1066,"What is this \"Other\" category of US federal spending and why is it so high compared to 2008?",NEGATIVE,"In researching this question: \" Where did all this deficit come from? \" - I stumbled on the fact that \"Other\" spending catgory was the 4th largest spending increase in 2009-2012 period compared to 2008. NOTE: the figures are NOT total spending, but how much that year's spending increased compared with 2008 What exactly is this spending category? Why is that spending so high and what contributed most to it?"
1067,Do people in USA need official permission to demonstrate?,NEGATIVE,"In some countries, people who want to demonstrate need to get official permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs in advance. In order to get that, they have to elaborate their reason and specify the path they want to march through. If they can get the permission, then their demonstration is lawful. Otherwise, it is recognized as an illegal action, and thus they might face penalty. Now the question is: do people or groups who want to demonstrate in the US need to get official permission? Do they have to pass a similar procedure?"
1068,"",NEGATIVE,"According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priority, the Other category includes everything not accounted for in the other categories. This includes: Benefits for federal retirees and veterans: This subcategory combines the veterans' benefits and services function (700) and the federal employee retirement and disability subfunction (602, which is part of the income security function). Transportation: This subcategory consists of the entire transportation function (400). Education: The education subcategory combines three subfunctions of the education, training, employment, and social services function: elementary, secondary, and vocational education; higher education; and research and general educational aids (subfunctions 501, 502, and 503 respectively). Scientific and medical research: This subcategory consists of the general science, space, and technology function (250), and the health research and training subfunction (552). Non-security international: This subcategory consists of the international affairs function (150) except for international security assistance, which is included with defense, above. All other: This subcategory consists of all other federal expenditures. Unfortunately, the White House OBM isn't as easy to search as I would like, so it is difficult to find out hwy that category increased so much. I suspect that since the largest chunk of it in 2011 (7% of total budget) was Benefits for federal retirees and veterans, that is most likely the cause."
1069,"",NEGATIVE,"For the most part no. If you have a location that is amenable to have a gathering you do not need to get permission for the group to demonstrate. The ACLU has a great summary of how free speech and the right to assemble work in the USA. However if you want to do so in a public space then you may (and most likely do) need a permit from the local (Usually city or county) government to use that public space for your demonstration. In general speech is protected so the permit issuer must have a very compelling reason to deny a group a permit. That the agency does not want your group demonstrating is not enough to deny the permit with a very few exception like those groups that have been found to be criminal organizations through the RICO act, or your group has a standing injunction from the courts that prevents them from demonstrating in the jurisdiction. The occupy Blog put it this way: Yes, generally you cannot protest outside of a person's house. (This can be different for a public official. Keep in mind that if the house is located in a residential area, there can be strict limits on noise, parking, etc. ) There may be limits on protesting outside of someone's place of business. Harassment is not a protected form of speech, so it depends on what your protest is about and why you would be in front of someone's house. Also, many locations limit or prohibit protesting outside a medical facility. Many publicly-owned schools, especially grammar and high schools, do not allow protesters on the property. There may be limits in parks; most cities require a permit to hold a protest in a park if the group has more than a given number of participants. Common numbers are 25 or 50. Check the municipal law. Most parks contain protest activity to certain locations. Most parks also limit or prohibit the use of sound amplifying devices, such as amplifiers or megaphones. You need to check the local laws and the rules regulating a place. If you plan to hold a protest in such a place, you would be wise to consult with a lawyer first."
1070,"",NEGATIVE,"OK, I have extracted the spending data from http://www.usgovernmentspending.com into a spreadsheet, and here's what I came up with: 1) \"Other\" category of spending contains the following sub-categories (I have only included those that have non-zero federal spending): Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunti Basic research Communication Community development Economic affairs n.e.c. Fuel and energy General economic, commercial and labour Housing development Pollution abatement Protection of biodiversity and landscape Recreational and sporting services Water supply 2) Here are the figures for \"Other\" Federal spending, 2002-2012. I have sorted by overall averages and included 2002-2008 and 2009-2012 averages. I have highlighted as yellow those elements that are >30% off from overall average. I have highlighted as pink those elements that are >30% off from cohort (4-year)average. As you can seem the largest components are Agriculture, Community Development, Basic Research, ad Housing Development (which jumped from #4 in a decade to #1 since 2009, due to assorted housing market subsidies etc...). An additional spike was Economic affairs in 2009, most likely due to TARP spending, but that did NOT affect the averages too much (only 50% growth) since most of TARP was repaid in 2010/2011."
1071,"What benefit does Ireland get for the tax policies that faciliate the \"Dutch Sandwich\"",NEGATIVE,A popular tax avoidance scheme known as the Dutch Sandwich allows corporations to avoid US corporate taxes. I can understand the benefits to Holland which ends up being the destination of the profits. I can understand why US politicians are willing to continue the policy in the face of extensive lobbying and campaign contributions. But what is the benefit to Ireland to be the pass through nation that facilitates these transactions?
1072,"",NEGATIVE,"The benefits to Ireland are obvious (if not very large), but compared to literally zero costs, they are still very attractive: There are still some profits taxable by Ireland (smaller, but non-zero). A tax on non-zero small profit is a marginal benefit over not getting a tax on anything. The Irish authorities never see the full revenues and hence cannot tax them (Wiki). Note that it doesn't say \"never see any revenues\". The profits don’t stay with the Dublin subsidiary, which reported pretax income of less than 1 percent of sales in 2008, according to Irish records (src: Bloomberg). Again, note that &lt;1% of sales * 12% tax is still infinitely more than $0 which Ireland would have collected in taxes if Google did NOT set up the scheme. An extra data point to show that it's still Real Money: Turnover at Google Ireland Limited jumped to €10.9 billion last year, from €7.9 billion in 2009, and now accounts for roughly 40 per cent of the search engine giant’s global earnings. Google earnings are driven by online advertising revenue. (src: IrishTimes ) So, I'm gonna guesstimate that taxes paid to Ireland were €10.9B*0.01*0.125 = €13.6M in 2010. Presumably, registering companies in Ireland adds some funds (again, possibly marginal but non zero) amounts to Irish economy and employment. General employees, lawyers, accountants, yadda yadda. That licensee in turn owns Google Ireland Limited, which employs almost 2,000 people in a silvery glass office building in central Dublin, a block from the city’s Grand Canal. (src: Bloomberg)"

1074,Is it allowed in the United States to advertise for a peaceful political meeting in social networks against the government?,NEGATIVE,Is it completely illegal and do people who have committed it have to face fines and punishments? I asked because the same matter has negative consequences in some other countries.
1075,When was the last face to face meeting between Iran government and USA government?,NEGATIVE,"While we know there is no official political relationship between Iran and USA, I want to know about the last one. I do not know about unofficial meetings or phone calls which may happen."

1078,Does the US 2013 sequester affect politicians own salaries and benefits?,NEGATIVE,"From Big cuts spur calls to Congress from irate constituents, Thomas Ferraro, Reuters: They have not worked together in Washington. And so the across-the-board cuts of the so-called 'sequester' - which both Republicans and Democrats have said they oppose - took effect Friday night after President Barack Obama and Republican leaders failed to agree on a way to replace them with targeted spending reductions. Up until the final few days before Friday, when the reductions began because of a law enacted in 2011, constituents urged, some begged, lawmakers to avert them. The cuts threaten the U.S. economic recovery, could disrupt federal services from airports to national parks, and may force furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and employees of federal contractors, the administration says. 'They want to kill us all,' Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said of his constituents. The fact that the senator chooses the word us makes me wonder: does this sequester thing have any effect on politicians own salaries, benefits, working conditions, etc.? Or are they somehow exempted from the 'across the board' cuts?"
1079,"",NEGATIVE,"No. There was a bill to fix that, proposed by Rep. Charles “Charlie” Bass [R-NH2]. Under a bill offered by Rep. Charlie Bass (R-N.H.) ..., Obama, Vice President Biden and all members of Congress would get an 8.2 percent pay cut if they cannot find a way around the sequester, which will cut federal spending by $109 billion starting in January.

The 27th Amendment prohibits members of Congress from changing their compensation until after the next election."
1080,"If a bill was referred to a Committee, and died there, is there a way to tell what happened?",NEGATIVE,"In this answer, I linked to a bill that was listed as dead in a Committee. Another user asked what happened to the bill, why did it die and who supported/opposed it (votes or otherwise): Where can I find the voting result or more about debate on this bill? How can the answer to this question be discovered? I'd prefer a generic answer applicable to any bill, but an example of how to find out for this specific bill is sufficient.

1081,"Given my list of convictions, which US party(ies) should I consider?",NEGATIVE,"Suppose I have the following political views: I am for greater government regulation of economy and oppose privatization I am for greater taxes for the rich and less taxes for the poor I am for free universal medical care and education I am against recognition of gay marriages although I support sexual freedom I am strongly against feminism, anti-pedophile hysteria, \"harrassment laws\", rising age of consent, quotes for women in the government and business I support a ban on abortions I am strongly against \"affirmative actions\", compensatory discrimination, quotes for the blacks and Hispanics in the universities I am strongly against civil possession of weapons (except hunting ones for certified hunters) I am strongly against legalization of drugs, including marijuana. I am strongly against any kind of euthanasia, including consensual. I am strongly against influence of the religious organizations, especially in education I am also against any forms of racial discrimination. I would also support a ban on any Neo-Nazi propaganda and parties as well as historical revisionism. I am strongly against the US participation in the wars abroad and financial support to various revolutions I am against extension of copyright protection terms and software patents, I support declaring not published for a long time works a public domain. I am against the concept of \"intellectual property\"."
1082,"",NEGATIVE,"OK, there are different alternatives, none of which is a full fit, and most of which don't actually represent any viable (or even registered) party in modern USA. The fit would depend on which of the bullet points you are most willing to sacrifice. Let's group these together into larger themes: Economic statism/populism I am for greater government regulation of economy I am for greater taxes for the rich and less taxes for the poor I am for free universal medical care and education These obviously immediately exclude libertarian type parties as well as GOP. But these fit perfectly well with any/all \"left wing\" parties. Social anti-progressivism (opposition to typical progressive social policies)... I'd call it social conservatism but there are subtle differences there, such as the fact that American social conservatism is almost invariably PRO-religious and conflicts with #3 below. I am against recognition of gay marriages although I support sexual freedom I am strongly against feminism anti-pediphile hysteria, \"harrassment laws\", rising age of consent, quotes for women in the government and business I support a ban on abortions I am strongly against \"affirmative actions\", compensatory discrimination, quotes for the blacks and Hispanics in the universities This immediately excludes most of \"left wing\" parties, from Democrats to most socialists/communists. Those of Stalinist bend would fit this but those are pretty thin on the ground in USA in practice. OTOH, this is a good-to-halfgood fit with \"right wing\" parties, from GOP to libertarians (the latter fit 2 of 4 bullet points). Anti-religious. I am strongly against influence of the religious organizations, especially in education Now, this gets even muddier. You are now an obviously bad fit with most of GOP (where typical religious social conservatives have great power), but fit both libertarian wing of GOP as well as any/all leftish parties. Foreign policy isolationism I am strongly against the US participation in the wars abroad and financial support to various revolutions. Oh, goody. Muddier and muddier. You are still good friends with assorted left wing parties - but ALSO, with both peacenick wing of Libertarians (Ron Paul) - AND with isolationist ultra right wing of GOP (Pat Buchanan and co). The latter is important. I am also against any forms of racial discrimination, especially, Anti-Semitism. This clearly excludes nazi type parties, or Islamists (anyone who thinks Islamists are against racism need to go research history if Islam in Sudan). The complication arises when you deal with racism. Leftists accuse GOP and libertarians of racism because of opposition to affirmative action or any preferential treatment for minorities. Rightists accuse leftists of racism against whites AND subtle racism against blacks for insisting on preferences that support blacks (even prosperous ones) over whites (even poor ones). To top that off, many right wing type people accuse hard left ones of anti-Semitism, due to very-anti-Israel stance (e.g. hating on Israel for killing 10 arab militants and totally ignoring Al Assad or Saddam killing hundreds and thousands of same exact Arabs) as well as deep belief of far left in typical anti-Semitic accusations (Jews run Wall Street, masons, Jews caused war in Iraq, etc...). Given your views expressed in #2, you will most likely disagree with left wing trying to paint GOP or libertarians as violating this; and might possibly agree - not sure - with right wing accusing hard left of this. Anti-IP/pro-piracy. I am against extension of copyright protection terms and software patents, I support declaring not published for a long time works a public domain. Now, you got two friends. Major one is the leftish wing of Democrats as well as more lefty parties... EXCEPT you're sh1t out of luck with Democrats as a whole party since a vast majority of their power structure are deep in the pockets of RIAA, MPAA and Hollywood, no matter how the individual membership feels. A second friend is libertarians, at least a subset of them; since they view SOPA and such as less of an expression of free markets and capitalism and more of government-run-economy-rent-seeking. ALso, many in GOP and libertarian party hate entertainment industry for leftist views, and tend to be a lot less opposed to piracy than their typical law and order ideology allows for. So, where does that leave you? Depends on how much you're willing to sacrifice: The best fit for you would be a direct USA clone of USSR Communist party. Every single one of these 6 views matches them (down to foreign policy non-interventionism, where they are/were fully on board with Russia/USSR doing it but firmly against USA doing it). The only problem is that such a beastie does NOT quite exist in USA as a political party - a vast majority of US left wing parties, Communist included, tend to have much more progressive social policies (#2) - see below. Big Caveat - while on paper, KPSS was against anti-Semitism, in practice it was more antisemitic than almost any party in USA you can find except neo-nazis. None of them would, at least, support the concept of limiting the amount of Jews accepted to a university, which was a standard Soviet practice, well into late 1980s. SCORE: 4 fully supported (#1,#2,#3,#6). #4 as applied to USA but not as universal ideology. #5 supported on paper but NO in reality. If you are willing to sacrifice #5 (no anti-Semitism/racism), a second best fit for you would be some sort of real fascist party (Charles Lindbergh type people, not the fact that typical Democrats are calling GOP Nazis). Those people definitely match #1, #2, and #4. True fascists (Italy/Germany) mostly supported #3 as well, but the problem is that almost all American proponents, both now and in the past, were quite religious and would disagree on #3. The only possible deviation might be #6 (patents), I simply don't have a clue what fascists thought of that, but quite possible they would be pro-SOPA etc... for philosophical reasons. Another wrinkle is that #4 was supported in USA at least in part because any foreign adventures would be against Nazi Germany, and not out of ideological isolationism. SCORE: 3 fully supported (#1,#2,#6). #3 supported by originals but not USA clones. #4 as applied to USA but not as universal ideology. Definite no: #5 If you are willing to live completely without #1 AND half of #2, you found an almost perfect fit. Objectivists and Objectivist bent libertarians. The main wrinkle here is that a lot of them are 1/2 divergent with you on #2 (social anti-progressivism). They all oppose militant feminism and affirmative action, and many oppose late term abortions for scientific reasons (e.g. after the age when a fetus would be viable if it was delivered in nICU). But many of them support abortions in first trimester, and a vast majority couldn't care less about opposing gay marriage (though an even greater majority would prefer marriage to be separated from State in the first place, gay or straight). NOTE: here's an interesting thing... if #1 is important for you as long term goal as far as \"decent living for all\" goal but not ideologically, libertarians would argue that their approach (less government control of economy) is MORE likely to lead to your goal than the opposite approach. If you have doubts, compare level of life of the poorest people in the an urban ghetto in USA vs. random poor worker or peasant in USSR who lived far from the center in late 1980s or 1960s (when people were not artificially subcidized by selling oil to the west as under Brezhnev). SCORE: 4 fully supported (#3,#4,#5,#6). #2 supported 50%. Definite no: #1 If you are willing to live without #3, and care about #4 and #5 (isolationism AND avoidance of racism/antiSemitism, at least on official level) more than about #1 and #6, you may mesh to a degree with Pat Buchanan ultra right social conservatives. There, you have people most of whom don't have strong views on #1 (even if they proclaim the opposite, they frequently agree with more populist slogans) Unlike the next set of choices, they support #4 on philosophical/ideological grounds. So if #4 is very important to you, this fits better than fascists or Islamists we will talk about next. Admittedly, they were historically associated with racism and anti-Semitism, but these days many of them just no longer care about opposing #5. They definitely are less antiSemitic or racist than the next bunch. SCORE: 2 fully supported (#2,#4). No strong views on #1/#6. Definite no: #3. #5 is iffy, but more support than some other alternatives. If you are willing to live without #3, #5 and possibly #6, but care about #1, you would be a great fit with two different forces: American style \"christian-sourced\" fascists like Lindbergh and neo-Nazis (admittedly, some of them would disagree about #1 to a degree, but most couldn't care less, and many think Hitler was right and economic populism FTW). Islamists who wish to institute sharia but also like socialist economics (not all do, but many fit). They don't have a party per se, officially. However, Islamists share a problem with real fascists in that their support for #4 (isolationism) is mostly due to whom USA would be opposed militarily, NOT deep seated philosophical objection. They are against wars in Islamic countries, but would be happy if US decides to fight Israel. So, if #4 is ideologically important to you, go with Pat Buchanan instead. SCORE: 2 fully supported (#1,#2). No strong views on #6. #4 as applied to USA but not as universal ideology. Definite NO: #3, #5. If you are willing to sacrifice #2 and to a large extent #5, you are on board with most of progressive left (socialists, communists, Greens, left wing of Democrats). While most of them loudly proclaim that they are against racism and anti-Semitism (and accuse right wing of those), a large chunk of them are hugely anti-Semitic due to ideological alliances with Hamas and co (discussed in detail above). Also, from Libertarian point of view, their insistence that minorities be treated differently than whites is a sign of TWO different kinds of racism, one against whites, another a subtle racism against minorities (also discussed in detaiol above). The only extra caveat is that Democrats as an official party won't be a good fit for #6 due to their leadership, as mentioned before, being a fully owned subsidiary of entertainment industry and thus strongly pro-IP, so #6 is thrown out along with #2 for Democrats as an organized party. SCORE: 4 fully supported (#1,#3,#4,#6). Definite NO: #2, and I would argue #5. As an aside, you may notice that none of the 2 major parties that actually get to win nationwide elections fit at all. GOP only fits #2 fully; the party largely doesn't fit #1, #3 and #4, and some elements of its leadership don't fit #6 (but less so than Democrats). #5 is debatable but the Democrats claim that GOP dones't fit it either (unfairly, IMHO, and given your views of #2 you probably agree with me). Democrats only fit #1 and #3 fully. They don't fit #2 at all, their leadership doesn't fit #6 at all and doesn't really fit #4 for real either despite all the peacenick talk; and they are accused by right wing of not fitting #5."
1083,"",NEGATIVE,"I am for greater government regulation of economy and oppose privatization Democrats are for greater regulation. But aren't opposed to privatization. Communists would be cool with both. I am for greater taxes for the rich and less taxes for the poor This would tend to fit the very definition of 'progressive tax policy' of the democrats. I am for free universal medical care and education Democrats are more for this than Republicans, but you likely are wanting to go with the Socialist party or perhaps Green Party. I am against recognition of gay marriages although I support sexual freedom As a blanket statement, the GOP would fit the bill there. But we'd have to have more context to really answer this (is it the terminology? The concept?) I am strongly against feminism, anti-pediphile hysteria, \"harrassment laws\", rising age of consent, quotes for women in the government and business That's a weird mix of things. Again, likely need more context to answer that. I support a ban on abortions Again, as a blanket statement, the GOP would fit the bill there. But, also again, we'd need more context. I am strongly against \"affirmative actions\", compensatory discrimination, quotes for the blacks and Hispanics in the universities Republican and Libertarian Parties would fit the bill. Depending on how emphatic you are about that, you may even side with some of the more extremist parties that tend to focus on segregation. I am strongly against influence of the religious organizations, especially in education There really isn't an anti-religious party. The GOP obviously tends to market their message to the religious more than the rest these days. So maybe stay away from that one. I am also against any forms of racial discrimination, especially, Anti-Semitism. This may be counter to your previous statement about being against affirmative action, given that that was implemented as a response to the fact that many do discriminate on race. We'd likely need more details to hash out that dissonance. I am strongly against the US participation in the wars abroad and financial support to various revolutions Likely need to go with one of the leftist parties. Green, perhaps. I am against extension of copyright protection terms and software patents, I support declaring not published for a long time works a public domain. I am against the concept of \"intellectual property\". Hmm...I'm not sure which party would specifically appeal to you there. There's a rather large spectrum there between 'against copyright extension acts' and 'abolishing the concept of intellectual property'. I'm not sure there is a party that would particularly fit the latter. In the end, it's going to be rare that one particular party will meet a particular voter's list of wishes, unless the voter tended to have a very short list. As your list gets longer, the key is to start prioritizing them. Which are the major issues, which are secondary, tertiary, etc."
1084,"In the US, why do libertarians tend to side with the GOP rather than the DNC?",NEGATIVE,"A generic way to define a libertarian in the US could be 'fiscally conservative, socially liberal'. Given that the two major parties (GOP and DNC) tend to (again, speaking generically) be diametrically opposed to each other on both of those broad categories of issues, why does it appear that Libertarians tend to side more with the GOP? Is that actually the case? Or is that the GOP attempting to market to a particular political mindset more so than the other party? Does the actual Libertarian party affiliate with one of the two major parties more than the other? UPDATE: So, some random theories. Are any of these valid? The Republican Party is better at framing their agenda's messaging to better appeal to libertarians. Libertarians feel the Republican Party is more amenable to their ideals and easier to enact change within. Libertarians have a platform that overlaps parts of both primary parties, but tend to prioritize the platform items that overlap with the GOP more so than the ones that overlap with the DNC. The term 'Libertarian' is fuzzy, and the ones that find the GOP appealing are merely adhering to one definition of libertarianism in the US and don't represent all libertarians."
1085,"",NEGATIVE,"\"Socially liberal\" is accurate in the sense that Libertarians oppose regulation, interference or curtailing of the rights of the individual by government. This extends to \"interference\" in the form of social safety nets (particularly those provided by public funding through taxation), which are core to the liberal platform."
1086,"",NEGATIVE,"When a bill dies in committee, it does so because there is nothing that pushes it to the floor. This can happen for several reasons; the reason will dictate what more information is available. It could be voted down by the committee. If this is the case, the \"Progress\" indicator will indicate that a vote was taken in committee, but that it failed. In rare cases, the whole Congress can take up the bill, if a majority of the chamber decides to bring it up, but this is uncommon, because the entire point of committees is to reduce the workload of the entire committee. More often than not, if a bill dies in committee, it is because the committee itself takes no action. This could happen because: a member put a \"hold\" on a vote - For example, nominations can be blocked with a secret hold. Holds are secret things, by design, that allow members to prevent publicity about their votes. Newspapers will sometimes report the fact that holds have been placed. A hold was originally a very informal thing - the member desiring the hold simply tells the chair, the whip, or the leader that he wants a hold. Beginning in 2011, however, the rules changed, and holds are now published in the Congressional Record. The Congressional Record itself is just a journal, meaning you would need to look chronologically through it to locate the action. The bill itself never came up because there was no time to bring it up. The calendar is one of the most powerful tools that the whip and the leader have - and it is surprising how little action is actually taken on most bills. Thousands of bills will be submitted in a term - very few will be acted upon. In many ways, the Congress is like the Supreme Court, which may receive 10,000 case requests, but only a few hundred will even be heard. If this is the case (and it is a very common case), the progress indicator will just say \"died in committee,\" because the Speaker, Whips, and Leaders are under no compulsion to explain the prioritization of each bill. One's best bet would be to contact the leader and ask why there was no action action taken. In all likelihood, you'll get a form letter back saying that it is of vital importance to the leader but that other legislation simply took priority, but that's probably the best you are going to get."
1087,"",NEGATIVE,"The high level reason is fairly simple. DNC poses more of a threat to libertarian ideals and way of life than GOP. The main philosophical concern of Libertarians is reduction of violence (or a threat of violence) and coercion in political life. All of the other things that characterize libertarians stem from that high level point. In practice, the main source of said coercion since at least 1930s comes from the government; therefore in practice, this means that achieving this philosophical goal requires limiting the power of the government. Between the two parties, the DNC is clearly 100% for increasing the power of central government - both as a goal and as means to achieving other goals. Whereas GOP is - while far from anarcho-capitalists - significantly less so (they still tend to grow government power, and wish to use it in politics for their ends - which is why they are Republicans and not libertarians - but their drive to do so is significantly less both in practice AND on ideological/philosophical level). Even in areas where GOP does seem (or is) to be supporting government interference, it is VERY frequently in areas that many libertarians either don't view as undue interference, OR where they disagree with the underlying premise by both parties, or both GOP and DNC are not all that different. To whit, the four main \"government interference\" items that GOP is usually accused of are: abortion, gay marriage, immigration, and military intervention abroad. Let's look at each one in detail: Gay marriage: First of all, libertarians don't support EITHER side here. Most of them want marriage equality via the means of turning marriage into a private contract between consenting adults, with ZERO involvement by the state. More importantly, while virtually no libertarian I'm aware of supports prohibition of gay marriage (e.g., if they can't get their preferred outcome, they prefer DNC's approach over GOP's), many of them simply view it as an issue to small in importance compared to other ones when choosing between DNC or GOP. I don't have polls to back this up, but a simplified version of what I just said would be: A libertarian is likely to vote FOR \"pro-gay-marriage\" specifically - e.g. in a referendum - but vote against politicians (\"D\") who are for gay marriage for reasons that have nothing to do with gay marriage but with the politicians' other policies. Abortion: It may surprise you, but for the vast majority of people opposed to abortion, that opposition has nothing to do with \"wanting power over a woman's body\". Nearly 100% of people opposing abortions view the aborted fetus as a live human being, and therefore view abortion as nothing short of killing a human. When viewed from that angle, opposing abortion is nothing more than opposing killing, and therefore is fully within the very few powers that the state SHOULD have, namely protecting lives via law enforcement. Note that some have such view for religious reasons, some have such view for purely scientific ones (e.g., for a fetus in a stage late enough that it would have survived in nICU if delivered prematurely, it's hard to make an argument that merely being attached to a placenta and not to nICU life support somehow turns the fetus from a live human being to \"perfectly fine to surgically excise part of mother's body\". So saying that \"but for GOP it is a matter of theocratic domination\" is a strawman. Immigration This is another one where purely practical considerations matter. Yes, in an ideal world, libertarians prefer unlimited immigration (citations to position statements trivial to find so I'll skip them). However, that ideal world includes one very important stipulation, that the government won't compel anyone currently residing in the country to help provide for the living of the people who choose to immigrate. As it is, that's not the case, and the immigration model as it currently stands serves to strongly enhance the welfare state, since all those immigrants get to be taken care of by the state (health, education, other welfare payments) if they are allowed to reside in USA legally without restrictions. You don't see Democrats offering to trade amnesty for \"no welfare/social payments to any newly legalized people, ever\", do you? Military aggression OK, this one is pretty much one of the main areas of disagreement between many libertarians and the hawkish parts of GOP. So why don't libertarians vote for DNC because of this? Reasons vary between different people, but some of them are: It's not like Democrats (as governing party, not as antiwar demonstrating individual voters) are terribly more peaceful compared to GOP. JFK was more of a hawk than Nixon, LBJ was deeply and fully committed to Vietnam War even if he didn't start it [ed. note JFK did](LBJ subscribed to Domino theory); Clinton military intervened in Serbia and Kosovo, and shot cruise missiles at Sudan and Afghanistan; Obama intervened in Syria, Libya, continued in Afghanistan and re-introduced troops into Iraq and greatly expanded the drone program of George W. Bush. And having left-wing government never stopped USSR from invading Afghanistan or being an aggressive military superpower. [Ed. note: Marxist theory calls for revolutionary terror as a \"necessity\".] Plus, for all their condemnation of US foreign adventurism since Bush, the socialist government of France happily got themselves involved in the war in Mali and before that, started the war in Libya. Some people simply take a more pragmatic view that defense of the country is the proper (only one of 2 proper) jobs of federal government, even if they are libertarian. Therefore they may object to specific foreign policy steps but don't have any inclinations to vote DNC just because they are \"less militarily inclined\". Remember that Eisenhower was a Republican. Some simply take the long view. ANY large and powerful government is more liable to be more militaristic, that's just how history shows the world works. Therefore, going back to the beginning of this answer, to them stopping Democrats from growing the power and size of government is actually synonymous with long term having less militaristic government. See USSR or Cuba. There are plenty of other topics where libertarians disagree with GOP but DNC would not be much of an improvement in practice based on observed history (war on drugs/drug legalization, prostitution legalization, SWAT and aggressive police tactics, censorship etc...) To view it another way, look at the stated ideal end goal (leaving aside that in reality the end state would differ from that end goal). GOP wants the country to be the way USA was in 1950s, sans segregation/racism. DNC wants the country to be the way France is now. Which of the two countries do you think a random libertarian would prefer to live in, 1950s USA sans segregation/racism; or 2000s France?"

EFTA has negotiated access to the EU single market and has partially accepted EU laws relating to single market access. It's also largely signed up to the Schengen area free movement of people. It doesn't have EU style common policies, such as agriculture, fishing, transport and regions however and it has no plans for the sort of economic and political integration implied by eurozone membership."
1091,"",NEGATIVE,"The libertarian party only represents a particular flavour of libertarianism, a.k.a. anarcho-capitalism. Other anarchists, such as anarcho-syndicalists, tend to oppose both the state and major corporations, but individuals may still consider the state as the lesser of two evils. For example, see Libertarian socialism and Left-libertarianism. The argument may go somewhat like this: in the past, feudalism and slavery were the norm. Lords owned their subjects, who had no rights but were at the whim of their lords. As social movements and revolutions progressed, this slowly made place for the rule of law; in some countries being gradually replaced by a government somewhat subjected to democratic control, in other countries being replaced by an authoritarian government claiming to represent workers interests. But even in the countries known as democracies, democracy usually extends only to the government, and not to the workplace; at work, policies are still dictated by the boss, as they were in the feudalist part. With the important difference that, at least in theory, anybody is free to leave. Left-libertarians may argue that freedom is not achieved by transferring power from a somewhat democratically controlled government to fully undemocratic companies, but that freedom and egality are achieved by an increased sharing of power. Now where such libertarians stand in the US political landscape, I'm not sure, but I strongly suspect the majority does not tend to side with the Republican Party. Major forces within the Republican Party have recently supported more corporate power (privatisations, lower taxes, etc.) and a restrictive government (invasive privacy rights, harsher sentences, Patriot act, stricter control on border and immigration, etc.). But such libertarians won't be big fans of the Democratic Party either. But I guess that if forced to choose between those two and only those two (and the first-past-the-post system effectively does force people as far as elections are concerned), they will likely vote for candidates from the Democratic Party."

(I'll leave aside the fact that Pres. Obama shared GOP's opinion on the topic till 2010 :) But how much of an issue is it electorally? More specifically, are there any research/polls/surveys that try to estimate how much of an electorate is lost to GOP on the margin because of same sex marriage issue? In other words, the poll/survey would ask something similar to \"If in the next election, GOP platform officially supported same sex marriage, would you change your vote from DNC to GOP\" if all other positions stay the same? (And vice versa, how many people would stop voting \"R\" if such a change happened)?"

Preachers in many religions may preach that men and women are fundamentally different, and even that men are superior to women. Followers of such religions may oppose feminism. I can understand why people would differ widely in their views as to the means of achieving equal rights, as many policies or campaigns can backfire and have unintended side-effects. But is there any non-religious opposition against the aims of feminism? What is the nature of this opposition? The Wikipedia article on Antifeminism is very limited. Clarification: I am looking specifically for non-religious reasons cited by non-feminists describing why they oppose feminism."

(Note: WA and MD have also legalized gay marriage) Same Sex Marriage just isn't a key issue for most voters. Take California, which you would think would have a high level of support for SSM, but 75% of Californians didn't consider it a key issue and of the 20 percent who would only vote for a candidate that shared their view it was split 50:50 for/against SSM."

1100,"What analogues exist for the Dutch Centraal Planbureau outside The Netherlands, if any?",NEGATIVE,"In The Netherlands, the Centraal Planbureau (Central Planning Bureau, Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis) is an independent government agency that delivers economic analysis of policy plans, among other things. Prior to the elections, all political parties deliver their plans to the CPB. Then the CPB calculates the effects on purchasing power, employment, economic growth, etc. Subsequently, each party cherry-picks the effects that favour their party and use this in campaigning and debates. The CPB also calculates the effects of government plans. A recent survey has shown that many people have little trust in the forecasts by the CPB, for example, here in Dutch. Perhaps peculiar: the electorate of the small-government party Democraten '66 have the highest trust, whereas the electorate of the pro-welfare state Socialistische Partij have one of the lowest. I consider myself one of those who has little to no trust in their calculations. Do any analogues of this system exist in other countries? Are there any countries where independent government agencies systematically calculate the economic effects of policy plans by government, opposition, or individual parties, and where those figures are then subject of political debate?"
1101,"",NEGATIVE,"Purely theoretically, CBO (Congressional Budget Office) in USA serves something of a similar purpose, but with a different scope. While the bureau you discussed calculates about policy by opposition, individual parties, etc..., CBO reports on specific topics, all approved bills, and special requests by Congressional Committees. how do you decide what you study? CBO’s chief responsibility under the Congressional Budget Act is to help the House and Senate Budget Committees with the matters under their jurisdiction. CBO also supports other Congressional committees—particularly the Appropriations, Ways and Means, and Finance Committees—and the Congressional leadership. CBO produces a number of reports specified in statute, of which the best known is the annual Budget and Economic Outlook. Other CBO reports that are required by law or have become regular products of the agency owing to a high, sustained level of interest by the Congress are described in our products. In addition, CBO is required by law to produce a formal cost estimate for nearly every bill that is “reported” (approved) by a full committee of either House of Congress; the only exceptions are appropriation bills, which do not receive formal cost estimates. (CBO provides information on their budgetary impact to the appropriation committees.) CBO also produces formal cost estimates at other stages of the legislative process if requested to do so by a relevant committee or by the Congressional leadership. Moreover, the agency produces informal cost estimates for a much larger number of legislative proposals that Congressional committees consider in the process of developing legislation. Beyond its regular reports and cost estimates, CBO prepares analytic reports at the request of the Congressional leadership or Chairmen or Ranking Minority Members of committees or subcommittees. CBO analysts work with requesters and their staffs to understand the scope and nature of the work that would be most useful to the Congress. And yes, CBO is nowhere near universally trusted. Here are random examples from recent years: http://reason.com/blog/2011/01/21/congress-used-cbo-to-get-the-a (headline: \"Congress used CBO to get the answer they wanted. I get that. I ran the CBO. They used me too.\") http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/medicare-monster_593652.html?nopager=1 (criticism from the right of estimates on health care) And just to offend everyone equally, it was ALSO accused of being biased AGAINST health care reform from the left :) (http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/the-stash/the-cbo-biased-against-health-care-reform) Discussion of overall CBO accuracy: http://www.minyanville.com/business-news/politics-and-regulation/articles/cbo-report-cbo-obamacare-cbo-fiscal/10/12/2012/id/44946?page=full&amp;refresh=1 A study done by economists Kevin Kliesen and Daniel Thornton published at the start of 2012 found that CBO budget outlooks are not that reliable. \"Using CBO deficit projections over the period 1976-99, we found that the deficit projections beyond a year were unreliable. Importantly, we found that the projections were biased in the direction of underprojecting the size of the deficit or overprojecting the size of the surplus,” the duo wrote in the January/February issue of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review."
1102,"",NEGATIVE,"It depends on the ruling that the SCOTUS passes. The SCOTUS ruling will apply to the laws of all States, but whether or not those states laws will be compatible with that ruling is hard to say at this point. For instance, if the SCOTUS says that Prop 8 is Unconstitutional because it says who you are able to marry(male or female) is determined by your gender, than that could make same sex marriage legal across the US. If it says that it is Unconstitutional because it gives some benefits to heterosexual couples, and withholds them from other couples, than some states might be able to get by with current laws if they just afford equal benefits to all couples."
1105,"",NEGATIVE,"For those of you looking for a shorter and more digestible answer: Feminism is a somewhat vague term that can define any number of pro-women movements. Some movements indeed advocate for women to be equal under the law, but One can make the case that there some ways in-which women cannot be equal under the law simply because some scenarios apply to women and not to men. Childbirth is the most obvious example of such a scenario. This kind of feminism, however isn't a very controversial form of feminism The more controversial movements, however Advocate for women to be treated equally in by private entities who aren't involved with the law. This includes issues such as employment practices and Political Correctness. Anti-PC people are opposed to some of these issues there are other people who believe that such issues ought to be outside the scope of law. And then there are other movements that go beyond, and advocate for Women to have extra rights. These movements tend to be somewhat fringe, but not super-fringe."
1106,What is the language of the Swiss national parliament?,NEGATIVE,"In the European union parliament, armies of translators translate every word into all other languages.

In an item in the Swedish news tonight about the Swiss parliament not deciding to finance the Jas Gripen plane, the parliament president was speaking Italian, an opponent French, and a proponent Swiss-German.

1110,"",NEGATIVE,"The first amendment does not confer unlimited rights to speech, but rather guarantees \"free expression.\" In Schenck v. US, (1919h, Oliver Wendell Holmes most famously gave the hypothetical of \"shouting fire in a crowded theater\"). The right to cause panic is not the same as the right to freely express a political opinion. When there is an overwhelming state interest in protecting a portion of the population, speech can be regulated. Common decency amongst large portions of the population suffices as a similar compelling state interest - there is a legal right to shield your children from obscenity. As Potter Stewart famously wrote of pornography in Jacobellis v. United States, I know it when I see it. Regardless of whether or not one thinks this is an abridgment of free speech, there is legal precedent and reasoning for it. Indeed, the overall rationale for the FCC requiring \"seven dirty words\" to be bleeped out (and for say, certain wardrobe malfunctions to be blurred) is that parents have as much right to shield their child's from obscenity as the producer of it has to make it available. In short, free expression means you can say what you want, but it doesn't require that I have to listen to it."

Anyways I wouldn't be surprised if there would be documents in Romansh as well in the depth of other documents. So to say I saw that at least speech level, the most common is German, then French, then Italian. I found it hard to get any information on spoken (not just native) languages, but by this source they say most of non-Italian native speaker pupils learn Italian at basic level, but they rarely use the language so even if we can call the population trilingual, most of people have strong preference on one language around the country."

1118,"",NEGATIVE,"There's certainly no one set of consequences that can come from a politician or government official giving an apology. However, the largest is related to a decline in power. Keep in mind that the study of politics is the study of power. You have to view the actions within a political system by how they affect an individual or group's power. The most notable consequence I can think of is lack of legitimacy. Governments must be seen as legitimate in order to exist (at least democratic ones). If governments and politicians continually apologize for their actions they are essentially confirming their illegitimacy or their inability to govern. This would result in loss of power, less representation of their party, and depending on what they are admitting, their party could be disbanded or banned (it depends on the country). Again, it all depends on what they are admitting that determine the consequences. The loss of power would explain the Tony Blair stuff you posted. Along with not wanting to look like he was wrong, he also was head of the party and doesn't want to lose credibility of the Labour Party. Another example I can think of is Turkey's denial of the alleged genocide in Armenia by the Ottoman Turks (before Turkey was a country as we know it today). Turkey probably won't lose legitimacy because it was an entirely different form of government, but there would be serious social and monetary repercussions of their actions. All in all, it depends on what they're not admitting and the history behind it."

The underlying issue in regards to the case of Prop. 8 is not whether same-sex marriage is legal or not. Prop. 8, of course, was passed as a ballot proposition to amend the California constitution. The Supreme Court will be deciding whether or not the proposition is constitutional AND if \"the people\" can use ballot initiatives to restrict the constitutional rights of others. This would give affected parties in any state the ability to challenge a ballot initiative or amendment that infringes upon or restricts constitutional rights. Like DVK wrote, it also depends on how the court rules in that it could affect only parts of the case and not others. Depending on the issue(s) at hand a court can rule in favor or against many parts of the case. The ruling in the spring of 2012 with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is a great example of this (though this was challenging an act of Congress rather than a ballot proposition)."
1122,"",NEUTRAL,The Fairs Act 1204 is still in force in Ireland.
1123,How is socialism in Latin America different from Bolviarian socialism led by Chavez?,NEUTRAL,"As title says, how is socialism in Latin America generally different from Bolivarian socialism led by Hugo Chavez? I heard that there were many differences, so I wonder if anyone can answer this."
1124,Who can be nominated for Governor of the Federal Reserve system?,NEGATIVE,"I know the President of USA appoints, and the US Congress confirms, the Governors of the Federal Reserve system, and that there can not be 2 Governors from the same Federal Reserve District, but can the President appoint anyone he chooses or does he have to appoint someone that belongs to one of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks? Only answers with sources please."
1125,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"There seem to be very few restrictions. 12 USC § 241 - Creation; membership; compensation and expenses: In selecting the members of the Board, not more than one of whom shall be selected from any one Federal Reserve district, the President shall have due regard to a fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests, and geographical divisions of the country. The members of the Board shall devote their entire time to the business of the Board and shall each receive basic compensation at the rate of $15,000 per annum, payable monthly, together with actual necessary traveling expenses. So, you need them to NOT share a Federal Reserve district, you need them to be a diverse representation of various economic interests and geographic areas, and they can not hold a competing job (shall devote their entire time to the business of the Board). The president can clearly pick pretty much any bumpkin as long as Congress will approve them. Case in point: Sarah Bloom Raskin (the last one in the Wiki list of governors - I'm sure I can easily find more if I bother checking the rest of the list). Nominated by Pres Obama in 2010. Her education is J.D. degree from Harvard Law School and a B.A. in economics from Amherst College (not exactly a stellar economics academic achievement - no MA, never mind PhD in Economics). Her only listed relevant experience is 3 years as Maryland state banking regulator. Commentary after the appointment was that she's expected to basically just serve as a yes-person to Ben Bernanke, it'd be interesting to check how that worked out. Contrast her with another Obama appointee, Janet Louise Yellen - an American economist and professor, who is the Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Previously, she was President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton, and Professor Emerita at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business. Decidedly NOT a random bumpkin."
1126,Is it true that the US president can execute anyone without a trial?,NEGATIVE,Sorry if this is a stupid question. I am not an American (i.e. Canadian) and I was speaking to a friend today and he told me that apparently Obama passed a law last year that gives the president the power to execute any American citizen without having an actual trial? Now please tell me this isn't true. Thanks.
1127,"",NEUTRAL,"In a roundabout way, there's some truth to that statement, though it's a bit more nuanced than that. It refers to the administration's claims that they have the power to go after high-level terrorist organizations--including targeting individuals (who could be citizens of the US). It's an interesting, but also complex issue that's really about how we define war and enemy combatants in the modern era. There's been plenty of coverage on it over the past year, so plenty to search on. Here's a more recent article that talks about the aspect of US soil, which eventually led to the recent Rand Paul filibuster this past week: http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/feb/22/obama-brennan-paul-assassinations-filibuster"
1128,"",NEGATIVE,"Short version: No and yes. Not \"anyone\" (see DA's answer for more detail, but, but yes, some people without trial, when \"an informed, high-level official of the U.S. government\" determines the target is an imminent threat, when capture would be infeasible and when the operation is \"conducted consistent with applicable law of war principles.\" (src) However, this is not new or unique to USA - heads of state always had ability to have enemy combatants killed outside judicial system - it's called \"waging war\". The only difference is that in this case, the definition of what specifically constitutes an enemy combatant is shifting away from early-20th-century idea of a uniformed member of an official state army, to include asymmetric warfare guerrilla fighters and their leaders despite not being associated with a specific officially recognized state. This is supposedly based on standard \"self defense\" war doctrine which is recognized by United Nations, although specific legal issues are subject to much debating and frequently are more a matter of opinion than law."
1129,"",VERY_NEGATIVE,"No, not anyone. US citizens on US soil, not posing an imminent threat may not be executed. What your friend told you likely stems from comments made by our current Attorney Genrral, Eric Holder. In response to a question about using drone strikes against US citizens, here in the United States, Holder wrote: [...] The question you have posed is therefore entirely hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no president will ever have to confront. It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States. For example, the president could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances like a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001. [...] After Rand Paul filibustered the nomination of John Brennan for CIA director, Holder clarified his remarks. \"Does the president have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on an American soil?\" The answer to that question is no.\" Under questioning by Senator Ted Cruz, Eric Holder seemed to be hung up on using the word appropriate, when asked if using a drone strike on a US citizen in the US who was not an imminent threat was constitutional. It is important to note that the US Justice Department does believe that they have the authority to execute US citizens that are not in the United States, that would be infeasible to capture, and that are not currently posing an immenent threat. This legal analysis, a 50-page internal memo, was performed a year before Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in Yemen, along with another US Citizen who wasn't the target of the attack. A white-paper version of the 50-page memo was released to the public, the Justice Department removing parts it considered protected due to attorney client privilege."
1130,"For the U.S. Christian Right, are Sunday store openings an issue?",NEUTRAL,"In The Netherlands and many other European countries, stores are (or were until recently) closed on Sundays, and particularly Christian parties (strongly) oppose allowing stores to be open on Sundays, arguing that Sunday is the day of God and that stores should be closed. (Labour unions also often oppose Sunday opening, although for entirely different reasons.) The United States' Christian right, according to Wikipedia, has views on education, the role of the government, family values, and other issues. In The Netherlands, the Christian right, as represented by the Reformed Political Party, has among their major issues to strongly oppose any liberalisation for Sunday opening of stores. Does the Christian right in the USA address this issue at all?"
1131,"",NEGATIVE,"In the US these are called 'Blue Laws'. They are still enforced in some counties throughout the country, but aren't nearly as predominant as they once were."
1132,"",NEGATIVE,"I think most of your statements fit well with Christian socialism. The only point that you'd probably be at odds with would be against influence of the religious organizations, especially in education. Wikipedia lists a number of christian socialist parties, but none of them in the United States of America. The late Hugo Chávez is named as a Christian socialist. Let me try to see how your points of view agree with his: I am for greater government regulation of economy and oppose privatization I am for greater taxes for the rich and less taxes for the poor I am for free universal medical care and education Without sourcing, I am pretty sure you agree with Chávez here. I am against recognition of gay marriages although I support sexual freedom There are a number of groups in Venezuela campaigning for the recognition of gay marriage. Chávez did express his support to legislate against discrimination against same-sex couples, but not for recognition of gay marriage. Depending on your definition of sexual freedom, you might be agreeing with Chávez. See also Wikipedia. I am strongly against feminism, anti-pedophile hysteria, 'harrassment laws', rising age of consent, quotes for women in the government and business This feminist is disappointed in Chávez lack of support of feminism, so you might agree with him here, too. I support a ban on abortions The Vatican expressed worries that Chavéz might water down illegal abortions, but not much has happened. I am strongly against 'affirmative actions', compensatory discrimination, quotes for the blacks and Hispanics in the universities I am strongly against civil possession of weapons (except hunting ones for certified hunters) Here is a big difference with Chávez, who has armed his population to protect against a possible foreign intervention (IIRC: I'll source this later). I am strongly against legalization of drugs, including marijuana. I am strongly against any kind of euthanasia, including consensual. Pretty sure there's no difference here. I am strongly against influence of the religious organizations, especially in education From the same article, the Vatican is also worried that Chávez wants to make education less religious. I am also against any forms of racial discrimination, especially, Anti-Semitism. I am strongly against the US participation in the wars abroad and financial support to various revolutions I am against extension of copyright protection terms and software patents, I support declaring not published for a long time works a public domain. I am against the concept of 'intellectual property'. (NB: I'm still working on this answer, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela might be pretty close to what you're looking for!)"
1133,"",NEGATIVE,"The blue laws (as DA's answer noted) are still on the books in some counties. However, these days many (if not most) of them aren't in place for religious reasons. One of the most famous locations in USA for blue laws is Bergen County, NJ (the only one of NJ's 10 counties having them - the state law was enacted in 1959). People very recently (1980?) rejected repeal of those laws in referendum, with main reasons being NOT religious but decidedly mundane - Bergen County is home to super large malls that people visit even from NYC, and people didn't want extra traffic and activity on Sunday (and the location of the largest malls, Paramus, actually introduced NEW blue laws in 1969, more extensive than state ones). ... Paramus's Mayor, Cliff Gennarelli, vowed an all-out fight against repeal of Bergen County's blue law. \"Paramus would be just an awful place to live without the blue law,\" he said. Among the burdens, he listed traffic on the side streets, extra demands on the police and emergency services, and inconvenience to residents. \"The big thing is the quality of life,\" he said. \"The only day streets are clear is Sunday.\" (src)"
1134,"",NEGATIVE,I can execute anyone with out a trial. I would then be guilty of Murder. I would argue that the same would be true of the a member of the government doing the same with out circumstances where they were defending the lives of others that would have been harmed if it were not for the immediate action. While the president has sworn to uphold the constitution and laws of the US the president is human and can decide to break that oath and the law if he chooses. If the president issues an illegal order it is the responsibility of the person whom the order was given to to then refuse that order. Otherwise they are equally guilty of breaking the law.
1135,"Was Hugo Chavez's regime an actual \"Bolivarian\" revolution?",NEGATIVE,"Hugo Chavez claimed that his government was \"Bolivarian\" Wiki sayeth: The “Bolivarian Revolution” refers to a leftist social movement and political process in Venezuela led by Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, the founder of the Fifth Republic Movement (replaced by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 2007). The \"Bolivarian Revolution\" is named after Simón Bolívar, an early 19th century Venezuelan and Latin American revolutionary leader, prominent in the Spanish American wars of independence in achieving the independence of most of northern Latin America from Spanish rule. Is that claim of Chavez's government/revolution being \"Bolivarian\" true? E.g. are the specific policies and ideas and government details of Chavez's government similar in any/many/all/no ways to Bolivar's?"
1136,"",NEGATIVE,"PearsonArtPhoto is wrong. All States can secede from the United States. You have to understand that the we Americans use the word \"State\" incorrectly. Just look into the name: \"United States of America. The name is based off of the 13 colonies coming together under a unified flag. A State in it's proper context is a nation. Germany, France, China, etc are all States. To get a better understanding of what the United States really is, look at the European Union and how they decided to make one currency. The European Union is just a hybrid in structure of the United States. They fall under one flag, but are broken up into individual countries. This is the same as the US. The US is nothing more than a collection of smaller sovereign governments. That is why each has their own State Constitution and also why laws in one State can contradict laws in another State, State budgets, etc just like any other country under the European Union. One countries laws are always the same as the next. So to answer your question, there are already 50 different countries. But to secede, the people of that State have a very short window to get the proper signatures collected to present to the President. But as we have seen after Obama's second election, Texas did get the proper amount of signatures compiled and sent to the President, but the President ignored it anyway. So yes, a State can secede, but the real question is \"Will the President adhere to it?\" The biggest hurdle / problem is that citizens don't recognize that whatever State they live in, it's really a country of it's own. When the people realize their State of residence is really just a country with it's own flag under a bigger umbrella, then they will have the numbers (and power by means of force) to secede whether peacefully or violently."
1137,"",NEGATIVE,"Yes, it is true, but usually understood as the right of the President's administration to kill anybody they choose outside the United States. As was later clarified by John Brennan, this is not a punishment for a crime but a preventive measure so to prevent crimes in the future. As such they include in the list not only confirmed criminals but also people who can be suspected to conduct or coordinate crimes against the United States in the future, say on the ideological basis. ==== The list of the people planned for the extrajudicial killings by the Administration can be compared to a similar, so-called \"Magnitsky list\" which was designed to exert pressure on foreign law enforcement, politicians and judiciary, especially the judges. Unlike the \"killing list\", the Magnitsky list is kept secret, a person can be threatened with possible inclusion into this list privately. A person in the Magnitsky list should be denied entry in the US and their property should be confiscated by any US subject or company who holds or stores it, even abroad (otherwise the company is subject to penalties). For example if a judge who took a decision against a pro-US politician or businessman stores his money on a VISA card, the money should be taken by VISA. Among the first people who made into this list (as was admitted) were the judges and prosecutors of the trial over Khodorkovsky, a Russian businessman who was accused in illegal privatization, tax evasion and murdering people via his security service. Although this is rarely discussed this list is international as well and spans all countries."
1138,What are the current international agreements on the Korean war?,NEGATIVE,"I am trying to get information on international agreements on Korean conflict. I can find only documents on the current border status, DMZ, but not on valid international contracts for example guarantees of help in case of renewal of the conflict. Let's assume if conflict escalates to war, who would be involved? I know USA supports South Korea as well as most of UN countries. Also a factor is that China is somewhat ideological partner of North Korea, but let's be realistic, China (fortunately) drifted far from Korean stalinistic view. So the question: which countries would be involved if North Korea invades South Korean territories? USA? Russia? China? Maybe Japan? Who else? Are there international level guarantees of supports?"
1139,Does Geneva Convention apply to countries which aren't signatories?,NEGATIVE,"In a hypothetical situation, if a country which is a signatory to a Geneva Convention is fighting a war against a country which is NOT a signatory, is the former country obligated to abide by Geneva Convention rules in this conflict? Or is that only legally applicable when both sides are signatories? (to address @CsBalazsHungary's answer, I am open to an answer that's more nuanced than \"yes\" or \"no\" - e.g. one that says that it applies but only if the non-signatory follows the rules of the Convention even without signing it)."
1143,"",NEGATIVE,"Many of the arguments for and against the Federal Reserve have to do with it being separate from the Federal government itself. The Fed (Federal Reserve, NOT the Federal government) was created as an independent entity so that it would not become politicized and have to bend to the will of politicians. There is something to be said about the inefficiency of politics and democracy. The creators of the Fed wanted to guard against this and allow the Fed to make the best \"apoltical\" policies for the country. However, for this same reason (being independent) the Fed has a lot of control over the value of the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. economy. People who argue against the Fed say that it has too much control over the dollar and the economy. By controlling interest rates it has the ability to increase and decrease inflation. It can also flood the market with dollars, or destroy it, to change the value of the dollar in relation to other currencies. As the Federal Reserve isn't really responsible to the Federal government, it's easy to see how any politician wouldn't like something they can't control to have so much power. It could seem they could at times be at odds. There is so much more to the operation of the Federal Reserve, but these are the basics. You should look more into the Federal Reserve because it definitely is an important, and interesting, institution in American policymaking."
1140,"",NEGATIVE,"By Wikipedia it is compulsorial. \"The Conventions apply to a signatory nation even if the opposing nation is not a signatory, but only if the opposing nation \"accepts and applies the provisions\" of the Conventions.[14]\" A signer shall not be the one who breaks the conventions first. If the opposing country breaks it, the convention doesn't apply anymore I checked the source, it is not a short one, I am not sure it is there but maybe it can be trusted. Further check would be good. Here is the related source. An update: From 1952 Commentary, published under the general editorship of Jean S. PICTET, Director for General Affairs of the Internatonal Committee of the Red Cross: The passage of the report just quoted shows how this not very clear provision should be interpreted. The Conventions, it says, should be regarded \"as being the codification of rules which are generally recognized\", and it is in their spirit that the Contracficg States \"shall apply them, in so far as possible\" So it seems in those extreme cases when the convention is violated by a non-signer, the signer should keep the convention as long as possible. But this is just a moral guide, they don't mention any penalty, enforcement."
1141,"",NEGATIVE,"A Convention is a treaty between sovereign entities. Treaties are \"gentleman's agreements.\" Nothing more. As there is no authority over these sovereign entities, the term \"legality\" really doesn't apply. Even if a country breaks the Geneva Convention, there is no \"legal\" authority with rights to punish offenders - the effects of noncompliance are: Prisoners from the offending country already taken would no longer be \"guaranteed\" the rights afforded them - but technically there would have been no one to \"guarantee\" it the first place. The offending country would be subject to censure from \"the rest of the world,\" but the truth is they already were in that place before the supposed breach of the convention. As such, these \"obligations\" are already voluntary - there is no \"legal\" force behind them that can be brought to bear."
